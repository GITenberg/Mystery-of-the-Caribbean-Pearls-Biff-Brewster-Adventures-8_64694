<br /><span class="h2line2">Discovery!</span></h2>
<p>Lightning streaked the skies over the Windward
Islands. The Caribbean Sea was a tumbled mass of
foaming, angry waters.</p>
<p>The <i>chabasco</i> had struck with the quickness and
lashing fury that is the nature of this most feared of
tropical storms. A <i>chabasco</i> strikes without warning,
with tornado-like violence, whirling and smiting and
soaking. The storm ends as abruptly as it begins. The
air regains its calm. Only the churned-up waters continue
to smash upon the shore.</p>
<p>A final, brilliant flash of lightning revealed the
gaunt figure of a man stumbling through the raging
surf, fighting to reach the safety of the beach. He
staggered out of the roiling waters and fell face down
on the sand. His only motion was the agonized heaving
of his shoulders as he gasped for breath.</p>
<p>His boat, his diving gear were gone, smashed to bits
by the wildness of the storm which had washed him
ashore on this tiny speck of an island. The island, he
knew, was in the Baie du Tr&eacute;sor, Treasure Bay, off
the east coast of the big island of Martinique.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>As strength flowed back into the man&rsquo;s body, he sat
up. Frantically he shot his hand into a pocket of his
wet, worn, sun-bleached dungarees. An expression of
relief crossed his face. In the faint light of a rising
moon, he inspected the two objects in the upturned
palm of his hand.</p>
<p>He held two perfectly matched black pearls.</p>
<p>This was the end of his search, the end of weeks under
the blazing sun of the Caribbean; the result of
hundreds of dives to the bottom of the sea. He knew,
and he had the evidence in his hand, that he had made
a discovery which would startle the entire area of the
Caribbean Sea from the Florida keys to the coast of
South America.</p>
<p>He had discovered a pearl fishery so fabulous, so unbelievably
rich, that his find would make headline
news throughout the world.</p>
<p>He knew also that unless he could keep his find
secret until his claim on the pearl fishery was established,
treasure seekers and money-mad cutthroats
would descend on him like hungry sharks.</p>
<p>He felt sure that his actions and explorations had
been secretly watched. He knew who the watchers
were&mdash;unscrupulous men waiting hungrily to move
in and jump the claim he had struggled so hard to
find.</p>
<p>His first problem was to get off this tiny speck
in the bay and back to Martinique. He was no more
than five miles off the shore of the main body of the
big island. If he had reckoned his position correctly,
there was a long spit of land jutting out from Martinique
that he could reach by a two-mile swim. He
would need to rest. Calm now, he settled into the sand
to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>When the man awakened, the light of a brilliant
tropical morning proved that he had been correct in
determining his position. The sandspit jutted out, welcoming
him. Farther beyond he could see the lush,
green-covered pitons rising in the center of Martinique.
Some of these peaks reached a height of nearly
four thousand feet.</p>
<p>The man began his long, slow swim. He had no
fear of the sea&mdash;though he knew sharks abounded in
these waters, and he was unarmed.</p>
<p>But by midmorning he had reached the mainland
of Martinique safely. He was pleasantly tired from
his long swim, and stretched out on the warm sands
to rest and allow his clothing to dry.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon he reached the town of La
Trinit&eacute;, sprawling at the approach of Presqu&rsquo;&icirc;le de
la Caravelle, the peninsula that formed the Baie du
Tr&eacute;sor.</p>
<p>He found a room in a small <i>pension</i>, a rooming
house, and spent most of the night writing two letters.
One of them was addressed to his son in The Netherlands.
The other was to Charles Keene on the island
of Cura&ccedil;ao in the Netherlands Antilles.</p>
<p>Along with the letters, he carefully prepared two
small boxes.</p>
<p>In the morning, he was standing at the post office
door the moment it opened. It was with great relief
that he saw his letters and packages go into the
mailbag that would be trucked over the pitons to
Fort-de-France at noon, then flown on to Cura&ccedil;ao
on the night flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>In his relief and great elation over his discovery, the
man shed the characteristic watchfulness that usually
marked his movements. He momentarily had
dropped his guard, and did not notice that his every
action had been closely followed from the moment he
had arrived in La Trinit&eacute;.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Seeing Double</span></h2>
<p>The cablegram was short and to the point.</p>
<p>MAY I BORROW MY FAVORITE NEPHEW
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS STOP URGENT.</p>
<p>It was signed, &ldquo;Charles Keene,&rdquo; and had been sent
from Willemstad, Cura&ccedil;ao, in the Netherlands Antilles.</p>
<p>Biff Brewster, the favorite nephew referred to in
the cablegram, looked at his parents hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Martha, what do you think?&rdquo; Thomas
Brewster asked Biff&rsquo;s mother, as the three of them
stood in Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! I really don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo; A
frown spread over Mrs. Brewster&rsquo;s pleasant, friendly
face, drawing her arched eyebrows closer together.
&ldquo;It seems to me that Biff is away from home so much
of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, dear. But you must admit that we have
encouraged these trips. I still feel that travel is as important
to a boy&rsquo;s education as his formal schooling,&rdquo;
Tom Brewster replied to his wife&rsquo;s mild protest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Uncle Charlie says it will only be for a
couple of weeks,&rdquo; Biff put in. &ldquo;My spring vacation
starts next week. I wouldn&rsquo;t be missing much school&mdash;only
a day or two at the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked from his mother&rsquo;s face to his father&rsquo;s.
He wanted so much to go. In his mind&rsquo;s eye, he was
already seeing the sparkling waters of the Caribbean
Sea, dotted with palm-studded islands, long white
beaches, and coral reefs.</p>
<p>The Windward Islands, the Leeward Islands, Martinique,
Aruba, Barbados, Guadeloupe, St. Kitts&mdash;all
these colorful, romantic, exciting names raced through
the boy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your Spanish these days, son?&rdquo; Tom Brewster
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Dad. I&rsquo;m scoring well in it at school,
and of course I picked up a lot more Spanish when
we were in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was beginning to feel easier. His father&rsquo;s question
was an indication that one-half of his parents
was considering favorably Uncle Charlie&rsquo;s cabled request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How &rsquo;bout it, Mom?&rdquo; Biff pressed the opening his
father had given him. &ldquo;You know Uncle Charlie
and I always get along swell. We&rsquo;re a good team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Keene was Mrs. Brewster&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie&rsquo;s so reckless, though,&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster continued
in a voice registering protest. &ldquo;If I remember
correctly, you and he barely made it out of China
before getting into serious trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Biff had no answer to this statement. It was all too
true. He and Uncle Charlie had been flown out of
China&mdash;they had slipped across the border illegally&mdash;to
Rangoon in Burma and then on to the British
Crown Colony of Hong Kong, with Chinese Red
agents breathing down their necks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea what your brother is doing in the Caribbean?&rdquo;
Mr. Brewster asked his wife.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s mother shook her head. &ldquo;Not any more than
you have, Tom. Have you heard from your uncle,
Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one letter since we got chased out of China,&rdquo;
the boy replied. &ldquo;That came about a month after I
got back home. All he said was that things were too
hot for him to operate in the Orient for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is still with the firm of Explorations Unlimited,
isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Mr. Brewster asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Uncle Charlie said the company was
negotiating a contract that would have him operating
in this hemisphere. He didn&rsquo;t say what kind of operation
it was, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be tied in with his wanting you to come
to Cura&ccedil;ao, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way, Dad. What about it, Mom?&rdquo; Biff
looked hopefully at his mother. She didn&rsquo;t reply for
a few moments. Then she said, &ldquo;Well, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Brewster never finished her sentence. The
youngest members of the Brewster family burst into
the study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom! Dad! It&rsquo;s a cablegram!&rdquo; eleven-year-old Ted
Brewster shouted, waving an envelope over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Another one,&rdquo; Monica, Ted&rsquo;s twin sister,
chimed in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The twins were five years younger than Biff. Their
ambition was sometime, someday to travel &ldquo;a-<i>lone</i>,&rdquo;
as they emphatically put it. They listened goggle-eyed
to tales of the adventures Biff and his father or
Biff and Uncle Charlie had shared. On several occasions
the twins had gone with their parents and
brother to the romantic places where these adventures
had taken place. Mrs. Brewster, always present when
the twins were voyaging, had taken great care to see
that her two youngest were not exposed to the dangers
that had accompanied Biff&rsquo;s far-away adventures.
Ted and Monica could hardly wait until they were
old enough to take part in them themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you this time, Biff,&rdquo; Ted said. Excitement
shone on his young face. His eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager I can tell you who it&rsquo;s from,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster
said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Charlie! Uncle Charlie!&rdquo; Monica pealed, like
a gay bell.</p>
<p>Biff ripped open the envelope. The room became
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Uncle Charlie all right,&rdquo; Biff said. Then
he read: &ldquo;YOUR PASSAGE BOOKED SOUTHERN
AIRLINES FLIGHT ONE TWO NINE
TO MIAMI SUNDAY MARCH TWELVE. RE-PLANE
MIAMI FOR CURA&Ccedil;AO CARIB AIRWAYS
FLIGHT TWO NINE SIX. BE SEEING
YOU. LOVE TO ALL.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff handed the cablegram to his father and looked
at his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say my brother takes things pretty much
for granted,&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster said, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Charlie for you,&rdquo; Tom Brewster said.
&ldquo;When he goes into action, he moves fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He surely does, Dad, whether it&rsquo;s against Chinese
bandits or sending cablegrams,&rdquo; Biff agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;One cable this morning. A second this afternoon.
Well, I guess we&rsquo;d better be making up our minds,
Martha. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we all go?&rdquo; Ted wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;d love to go to the West Indies,&rdquo;
Monica pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will be just Biff this time,&rdquo; their
father said. &ldquo;Providing, of course,&rdquo; he added hurriedly,
&ldquo;your mother approves. Well, Martha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martha Brewster shrugged her shoulders and smiled.
She was still torn. But she had great confidence in her
son&rsquo;s ability to take care of himself. He had proved
this time and time again. And Charles was her favorite
brother, reckless though he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Biff darling. I might as well give in now
as later. I know you and your father won&rsquo;t give me a
moment&rsquo;s peace until I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Brewster&rsquo;s statement was met with cheers led
by Ted and Monica. Biff crossed the room and put
an arm around his mother&rsquo;s shoulders. She pressed her
head against her strong son&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>The conference in the Brewster home in Indianapolis,
Indiana, came to an end.</p>
<p>Sunday morning at ten o&rsquo;clock found the Brewster
family at the Indianapolis airport. Flight 129, southbound
for Miami, had already been called. The last
hasty farewells were said, and ten minutes later the
plane speeding Biff southward became a mere speck
in the sky to his mother and father and the twins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The plane zooming Biff to another adventure landed
at the Miami airport in the late afternoon. Coming in
over the city of fabulous hotels, America&rsquo;s playground,
Biff could see the lingering rays of the setting sun
slanting out over the bouncing waters of the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>
<p>From Carib Airways, Biff learned that the flight
which was to take him on to Cura&ccedil;ao was not scheduled
to depart until midnight. After a dinner of delicious
stone crabs, Biff wandered up and down Lincoln
Road, the famed shopping center in Miami Beach,
gazing into the windows of the shops which lined the
streets.</p>
<p>He left Lincoln Road and swung on to Collins
Avenue. One hotel after another, each in turn seeming
more luxurious than its predecessor, lined the east
side of the avenue, between the street and the white,
sandy beach.</p>
<p>The night air was warm and gentle in contrast to
the cold, blustery March winds Biff had left behind
him in Indianapolis.</p>
<p>Biff returned to the airport shortly after eleven, reclaimed
his baggage, which he had checked, and
waited for his flight to Cura&ccedil;ao to be called.</p>
<p>The call came just ten minutes before midnight:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carib Airways announces the departure of Flight
two nine six, for Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Willemstad,
Cura&ccedil;ao, and Fort-de-France, Martinique. Now loading
at Gate Nine. All aboard, please.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff joined the line which was moving slowly
through Gate 9. He looked carefully about him, as
he always did, spotting faces that he might run into
again. He had learned in the past that it was wise to
remember as much about one&rsquo;s fellow passengers as
possible. No telling when such knowledge might
come in handy. Besides, he found the faces of traveling
people interesting. On many long rides, he had
amused himself by trying to guess where they had
come from, where they were going, and why.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The line shuffled slowly forward. Flight 296 was
filled. There would be no seats for the hopeful
standbys.</p>
<p>Biff had checked his heavier bag through earlier,
when he had presented his ticket. Now he carried
only a small, light dispatch case. Accidentally, as the
person directly in front of him stopped suddenly,
Biff&rsquo;s dispatch case swung forward, striking the person
on the calf of one leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>The person turned around. Startled, Biff stopped
quickly. He even backed up a step in his amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I seeing things?&rdquo; Biff asked himself, giving his
head a shake and blinking. &ldquo;Am I asleep? It can&rsquo;t be.
It just can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person Biff stared at returned his stare. The
same astonishment spread over the face of the boy
he had bumped.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s own mirror at home couldn&rsquo;t have reflected
his image better. He might have been looking at himself!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Backfire</span></h2>
<p>Neither boy spoke, so startled were they by their
striking resemblance to one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Biff said, half aloud. &ldquo;That boy is&mdash;is&mdash;ME!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other lad must have been thinking the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step forward, please,&rdquo; the gate attendant called
out sharply. &ldquo;Keep the line moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their astonishment, Biff and his double had
stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>Dazedly, Biff and the other boy reached the gate.
They presented their tickets. The attendant looked
from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twins?&rdquo; he asked, a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Still apparently unable to speak, the boys shook
their heads.</p>
<p>They walked across the apron leading to the waiting
aircraft. As they walked along, side by side, each
cast quick, questioning glances at one another.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The boys were the same height. Both were broad
of shoulder. Both carried their well-muscled bodies
with the grace and posture of the trained athlete.</p>
<p>The only immediately noticeable difference distinguishing
the boys was their clothing. Biff was hatless,
as always. The other boy wore a hat. Biff wore
light gray slacks, a soft sleeveless sweater, and a loose
sports coat. His double wore a tight-fitting, dark-blue
suit and a white, high-collared shirt. His clothes were
as formal as Biff&rsquo;s were informal.</p>
<p>They mounted the loading ramp and entered the
plane. The stewardess gave them the same interested,
friendly look the gate attendant had given them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you two will want to sit together,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re twins, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Biff gulped.</p>
<p>The stewardess seated the boys, disbelief showing
in her eyes as they shifted from the face of one boy
to the other. She started moving toward the door,
but kept turning her head to cast a look at the boys.</p>
<p>Biff was seated next to the window. His seat companion
arose, removed his hat, and placed it on the
rack above. His hair was cropped short, as Biff&rsquo;s was.
It was a shade darker, perhaps, but just a shade. Biff&rsquo;s
habit of going hatless could have made the difference.</p>
<p>On close examination of the boys&rsquo; faces, there was
one noticeable difference. Biff&rsquo;s eyes were bluish-gray.
The other boy&rsquo;s were a deep blue.</p>
<p>Biff turned in his seat to confront his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we look so much alike,&rdquo; Biff said, &ldquo;maybe
we&rsquo;d better find out who we are. I&rsquo;m Biff Brewster.
So you can&rsquo;t be. I mean, if I am Biff Brewster&mdash;and
I know I was until I saw you just now&mdash;then you
must be someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Biff was having a hard time trying to say what he
meant. He wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure just <i>what</i> he meant.</p>
<p>The other boy smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to make your acquaintance, Biff Brewster,&rdquo;
he said quite formally. &ldquo;My name is Derek
Zook. I am from The Netherlands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek&rsquo;s English was good with hardly any trace of
accent. His phrasing, somewhat stiff and formal,
marked it as Continental, not American, English. It
was obvious that he had acquired his knowledge of
the language at school. His sentences didn&rsquo;t have the
free and easy swing of a native language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go to Willemstad in Cura&ccedil;ao. That&rsquo;s in the Netherlands
Antilles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Biff replied. His astonishment continued
to grow as the coincidences grew. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
there too. Here we are. We look alike, and we&rsquo;re going
to the same place. Now how about that!&rdquo; Biff
laughed. Derek joined in the laughter.</p>
<p>For the next few minutes the boys were quiet as the
aircraft taxied to its take-off runway. The four engines
revved up. The plane started rolling slowly
down the strip. It rolled and rolled, gaining momentum.
Then it was airborne, heading out over the
Atlantic toward Port-au-Prince, Haiti, nearly eight
hundred miles away.</p>
<p>During the flight, Biff and Derek became more and
more friendly. They had much in common, but Biff
noticed during the conversation that while Derek was
most willing to talk about his home in The Netherlands,
his schooling, and other, incidental topics, he
said nothing about why he was going to Cura&ccedil;ao.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Biff was cagey, too. If Derek wouldn&rsquo;t talk about
the reason for his flying across the Atlantic to visit a
speck of an island in the Caribbean, then Biff felt it
wise to say as little about his own visit as possible.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much Biff could tell, anyway. He
wouldn&rsquo;t know why his Uncle Charlie wanted him
until he saw him. Biff did tell Derek that he was going
to be met by his uncle, but he didn&rsquo;t tell his new
friend the kind of work Uncle Charlie did.</p>
<p>The plane flew high over the easternmost tip of
Cuba. Near three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Haiti was
spotted, a dark, shadowy mass in the grayness of the
dawn. High up over the Haitian mountains, the sky
could be seen lightening on the eastern horizon.
Neither boy saw it. They had talked themselves out
and were sleeping.</p>
<p>The plane went into a sharp descent for its landing
at Port-au-Prince. There was an hour&rsquo;s delay before
the plane took off on its next leg, the two-and-a-half
hour flight to Cura&ccedil;ao.</p>
<p>Derek was the first to stir. Biff opened one eye,
closed it again, and settled down into the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know our time of arrival, Biff?&rdquo; Derek
asked, his voice clear and wide awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout seven,&rdquo; Biff mumbled sleepily. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
some more shut-eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut-eye? I do not understand,&rdquo; Derek said, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; answered Biff. &ldquo;Good old sleep. But I can
see this is the end of it for now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wide awake, the two boys chatted in low voices
until the island of Cura&ccedil;ao, fifty miles off the coast
of Venezuela, came into view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The island is less than forty miles long and not
more than seven miles wide at its broadest point. From
the air, it looked like a long splinter. To the south,
the boys could see the mountainous coastline of oil-rich
Venezuela.</p>
<p>The plane began a long, gradual descent for its landing
at Willemstad. It came in low, seemingly only a
few feet above the spanking waves of the Caribbean
Sea. It shot over land and, minutes later, the crunch
of the aircraft&rsquo;s rubber-tired landing wheels was felt
throughout the plane.</p>
<p>As the plane rolled to a stop, an idea hit Biff. &ldquo;Hey,
Derek. I&rsquo;ve got a plan,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;A good one.
I&rsquo;d like to play a joke on my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, I like jokes, Biff. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff didn&rsquo;t answer right away. Some of the excitement
and eagerness faded from his face. &ldquo;I just
thought&mdash;somebody must be waiting to meet you, so
I guess my idea wouldn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure anyone is going to meet me, Biff. In
fact, I&rsquo;m almost certain no one will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was so busy thinking about his idea that the
significance of Derek&rsquo;s reply didn&rsquo;t register. Only
later did he remember the remark, and realize how
strange it was that Derek, who had come thousands
of miles, had no one to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case then,&rdquo; Biff went on, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I
have in mind. We look so much alike, I&rsquo;d like to try
and see if we can fool my uncle. So, if you&rsquo;re game,
here&rsquo;s my plan. You get off the plane first. Go right
into the terminal. If you look as much like me as I
think you do, and as others do too, then Uncle Charlie
will think you&rsquo;re me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>A grin came over the Dutch boy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does sound like fun. I&rsquo;d be Biff Brewster to
your uncle, wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll stay in the plane until you&rsquo;re in
the terminal. I&rsquo;ll follow you in about five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passengers were piling out of their seats now,
reaching up to the racks above for their hats and
coats. Derek retrieved his hat, turned to wink at Biff,
and started toward the front of the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Derek!&rdquo; Biff called. &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff got up and overtook his new friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid Uncle Charlie would spot you in a second
if you wore that hat. He knows I never wear one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek took off his hat and handed it to Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; Biff continued. &ldquo;Your coat. Looks
too European for me to be wearing it. Let&rsquo;s change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek doffed his suit coat and put on Biff&rsquo;s sports
jacket. Then he left the plane.</p>
<p>Biff, grinning in anticipation, waited until almost
everyone was off the plane. Then, wearing Derek&rsquo;s
coat and hat, he deplaned and walked toward the
terminal.</p>
<p>As he stood at the entrance to the terminal, it took
several moments for Biff&rsquo;s eyes to adjust from the
bright glare of the outside sun to the soft light of the
terminal&rsquo;s interior. He looked about, trying to spot
his uncle. He finally saw him, to the right, standing
in front of a cigar counter, smiling as he talked to
Derek.</p>
<p>Biff was starting toward his uncle and Derek when
two men entered the terminal from the street side.
They looked around quickly, saw Biff, and came hurriedly
over to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Derek Zook?&rdquo; one of the men asked.</p>
<p>Before Biff could protest or explain, the other man
grasped him firmly by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hurry. Your father is waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff found himself being hustled toward the terminal
exit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Who&rsquo;s Fooling Whom?</span></h2>
<p>Biff was wedged tightly between the two men. They
pressured him toward the exit. He could have resisted,
probably could have escaped in the crowded terminal,
but since they were moving in a direction that
would take them right past Uncle Charlie and Derek,
Biff decided against a struggle.</p>
<p>He saw that his uncle was watching the action
closely. Derek, fortunately, had his back turned. Biff&rsquo;s
&ldquo;friendly&rdquo; captors would not be able to see Derek&rsquo;s
face and remark the striking resemblance.</p>
<p>Within a few feet of Uncle Charlie and Derek, Biff
decided to make his move. He opened his mouth to
shout. Uncle Charlie fixed his eyes firmly on Biff and
shook his head. A big wink from Uncle Charlie
warned Biff further to take no immediate action.
Uncle Charlie tossed his head, gesturing toward the
exit door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Biff read these signals as quickly as if his uncle had
given them to him verbally. Uncle Charlie wanted
him to go with these men. Why, Biff didn&rsquo;t know, of
course, but he realized that his uncle must have a real
purpose behind his strange action.</p>
<p>Outside the terminal, Biff was hustled into a black
limousine. It was a long, sleek-looking foreign car,
all windows tightly closed. Was this to prevent any
outcry from being heard, Biff wondered? Or was it
simply because the car was air-conditioned against the
tropical heat?</p>
<p>As the car pulled away, Biff quickly glanced out of
the rear window. He hoped to see his uncle pulling out
in another car to follow. The streets, filled with
tourists, honking cars, and cyclists blocked his vision.
&ldquo;Well, he must be following me,&rdquo; Biff said to himself.
&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Biff was in the rear seat with one of the men. The
other was driving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had the good trip from The Netherlands?&rdquo;
the man asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From where?&rdquo; For a moment Biff had forgotten
the role he was playing; forgot he was impersonating
Derek. &ldquo;Oh, yes. Yes, very good,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It was
quite exciting, flying over the ocean.&rdquo; Biff was careful
not to mention which ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father, so anxious to see you, he is,&rdquo;
Biff&rsquo;s seat companion said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t he at the airport?&rdquo; Biff asked. He had
decided to play along with these men. So far they had
shown no outright enmity, had displayed no threatening
signs. Even so, Biff felt certain that should he
try to leap from the car, he would be forcibly detained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not well. His explorations at the bottom of
the sea have exhausted him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>One more bit of information, Biff thought. Now
he knew that Derek&rsquo;s father was searching for something
on the ocean bed. What? Sunken treasure?
These waters had been plied by pirates in the olden
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will welcome what you have brought him,&rdquo;
the man said.</p>
<p>Now just what could that be, Biff asked himself.
This man obviously was trying to pump him&mdash;trying
to get him to reveal some information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important to his search, no?&rdquo; the man continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, now,&rdquo; Biff thought. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;ll fall for that leading question.&rdquo; From the cautious
manner of the man&rsquo;s questioning, it occurred to Biff
that the man himself probably didn&rsquo;t know exactly
what Derek Zook was bringing from The Netherlands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am sure that I will be of much help
to my father,&rdquo; Biff said aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, good,&rdquo; the man replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, sir,&rdquo; Biff said, &ldquo;we have been together
for ten minutes, and although you know my name, I
don&rsquo;t know yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million pardons, my young friend. I am Herman
Dietz. And my friend driving is Sidney Cade. He is
more often called Specks, however. Perhaps you can
see why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff already had noticed that the driver&rsquo;s face was
covered with red blotches. Some of them were small
freckles. Others were unpleasant red spots the size of
a nickel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>For several moments they rode in silence. Biff was
fascinated by the sights around him. They were riding
parallel to a broad waterway. On either side, large
oceangoing ships were moored to gaily colored quays.
Cruise ships, Biff thought to himself. Shops lined the
sides of the quaint street along which they were traveling.
Tourists crowded these shops, which displayed
souvenirs, perfumes, colorful sea shells, shoes, neckties,
and women&rsquo;s handbags.</p>
<p>Dietz noticed Biff&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cura&ccedil;ao, you know, is a free port,&rdquo; he told him.
&ldquo;There are no duties charged on the thousands of
items for sale. That means that perfumes, for example,
which would cost fifty, a hundred dollars an ounce
elsewhere, cost only a small fraction of that amount
in Cura&ccedil;ao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff knew this fact. He meant to buy presents for
his family while in Cura&ccedil;ao. He didn&rsquo;t comment,
though. Dietz wanted to be friends. Biff felt it advisable
to go along with him until he showed his hand
more plainly.</p>
<p>Another block and the limousine turned into a
curving driveway and stopped in front of a white,
four-story building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; Dietz said, opening the door.</p>
<p>As Biff got out, he noticed a small, gold-lettered
sign reading: &ldquo;Hotel Del Mar.&rdquo; Just before mounting
the steps to the hotel lobby, Biff cast a swift
glance back in the direction from which they had
come. He saw a small sports car pull over to the
curb. He wasn&rsquo;t certain, but the two figures he saw
in the car could be his uncle and Derek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is here?&rdquo; Biff asked, as the trio crossed
the lobby to the elevators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is to meet us in a room upstairs,&rdquo; Dietz replied
as they entered an elevator.</p>
<p>Dietz&rsquo;s quick reply caused more doubts to grow in
Biff&rsquo;s mind. It seemed to him that any father, unless
so ill or injured as to be confined to bed, would certainly
want to meet a son who had made the long
flight all the way from Holland.</p>
<p>Stopping off on the fourth floor, Dietz led the way
down a long corridor to a room at the end. He took
out a key and inserted it in the lock. He didn&rsquo;t knock,
Biff noticed. &ldquo;Pretty rude,&rdquo; he commented mentally,
as Dietz pushed the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter, Derek,&rdquo; Dietz said.</p>
<p>Biff preceded the two men into the room. One
quick glance showed him it was empty. He heard the
door close behind him and the key turn.</p>
<p>Turning around swiftly, Biff challenged Dietz, saying,
&ldquo;My father&mdash;he&rsquo;s not here. And he has never been
here. You know that. Why was I brought here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dietz&rsquo;s reply was surprising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very clever, for one so young,&rdquo; Dietz
said smoothly. &ldquo;No, your father is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where is he? I demand that you take me to
him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be patient. Allow me to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time you did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Specks was standing with his back to the door, as
if expecting Biff to try to force his way out of the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been highly dangerous for us to
have taken you directly to your father,&rdquo; Dietz continued
his explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Biff demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has your father written you about a man who
was once in his employ?&rdquo; Dietz asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have, and he may not. That is my business
and my father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Biff answered in an angry voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ... and would that man&rsquo;s name be Charles
Keene?&rdquo; Dietz went on smoothly.</p>
<p>Now here was a twist, Biff thought. This is an
angle to explore more thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have heard that name,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;To be
truthful, I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must know that this Charles Keene represents
a great danger to your father and what he has
worked for so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This situation was growing more and more weird.
Dietz was talking about Biff&rsquo;s favorite uncle, but not
knowing it, of course. Dietz was completely convinced
that Biff was Derek and thought he was telling
Derek Zook about a complete stranger. Biff already
was beginning to get an idea of what Dietz was leading
up to. The double-cross was becoming clearer.
What Dietz didn&rsquo;t know was that he was double-crossing
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keene was discharged by your father. For good
reason. But this made Keene furious. He swore revenge
on your father.&rdquo; Dietz paused.</p>
<p>Biff could just see his Uncle Charlie&rsquo;s expression
when he passed Dietz&rsquo;s story on to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew that Keene would be at the airport to
meet you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could you have known?&rdquo; Biff asked. The
only way Dietz <i>could</i> have gotten this information
was directly from Uncle Charlie. Derek&rsquo;s arrival evidently
had not been foreseen, or Derek would have
expected to be met. But his, Biff&rsquo;s, arrival, had been
planned by his uncle. Why would Uncle Charlie have
passed this word on to Dietz? That question was a
real puzzler. Biff felt he might get more of the answer
by letting Dietz go on with his lying explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have kept a close watch on Keene&rsquo;s actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure, Biff thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew he planned to meet you at the airport.
It was his intention to prevent a meeting between you
and your father until he could extract certain valuable
information from your father. Only then would
he permit you to join him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just where do you come in on this?&rdquo; Biff
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;we are your father&rsquo;s friends. We have worked
closely with him. That is why he asked us to meet
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dietz was digging a bigger hole for himself to fall
into. Since he thought Biff was Derek, Dietz had no
idea, of course, of how he was giving himself away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had arranged to stop at this hotel just in case
Keene tried to follow us. I was sure that he would
try. He wants to know where your father is. But I
am equally certain that we have eluded him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure of that, Mr. Dietz,&rdquo; Biff
said to himself. Aloud, he said, &ldquo;And how can you
be sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go now to make certain. I will look around most
carefully. If I do not see Keene, then it will be safe for
us to take you to your father. Specks, here, will stay
with you to protect you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Biff wasn&rsquo;t fooled. He knew that Specks was being
left behind to keep him from escaping. From the
wily smile on Dietz&rsquo;s face, Biff knew that whatever
the plan was, Dietz thought it was moving ahead
smoothly. Biff smothered a crazy desire to laugh.
Dietz&rsquo;s plan would be working out successfully if the
real Derek were here.</p>
<p>One thing was very clear to Biff as Specks locked
the door behind Dietz. These men did not know
where Derek&rsquo;s father was. They were stalling. The
whole elaborate story Dietz had woven showed that.
His plan must have been to get Uncle Charlie to lead
him to Derek&rsquo;s father. Dietz had figured he could do
this if he could get to Derek first. When Charles
Keene failed to meet Derek, he would have to go to
Zook and explain. Dietz probably had planted a
man at the airport to spot and follow Keene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this all started,&rdquo; Biff said to himself, stretching
out in a comfortable chair, &ldquo;when I wanted to
play a practical joke on my uncle by having him
think Derek was I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it dawned on Biff. He couldn&rsquo;t have played
it the way Uncle Charlie had wanted any better if
Uncle Charlie himself had planned the switch in identities.
It looked to Biff now as if Uncle Charlie
didn&rsquo;t know where Derek&rsquo;s father was, either.</p>
<p>Parts of the whole puzzling experience had fallen
into place. But there were more pieces still to be
fitted together.</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie would know the answers. But where
was he? Nearly half an hour had passed since Dietz
had left the room. Specks, sprawled in a chair, still
watched Biff closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Idly, Biff rose and strolled across the room and
sauntered out on the balcony. He could feel Specks&rsquo;
eyes following him, but the man made no move.</p>
<p>On the balcony, Biff understood Specks&rsquo; inactivity.
There was little chance of getting out of the room
this way. The drop to the water below was at least
seventy-five feet&mdash;straight down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Appear and Disappear</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking of taking a swim?&rdquo; Specks called out.
&ldquo;Some dive you&rsquo;d have to make first, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff turned around. He could see the fat, satisfied
grin on Specks&rsquo; face. Biff recrossed the room and
stood over the comfortably sprawling Specks. He
wasn&rsquo;t too big a man. &ldquo;Bet I could take him,&rdquo; Biff
thought.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s determined expression seemed to alarm Specks.
He sat upright in his chair, but at the same time cringed
against the back of it. Some of Specks&rsquo; boldness had
left the room with boss Dietz.</p>
<p>Only one thing held Biff back and kept him from
mixing with Specks. What would he accomplish by
overpowering his guard? Where would he go? He
had to wait until Uncle Charlie appeared. And supposing
he was successful in taking Specks? Dietz
might come back before Uncle Charlie showed up.</p>
<p>As these thoughts raced through Biff&rsquo;s mind, a
knock came on the door. It was barely audible. Biff
looked at Specks and started for the door. Specks
leaped out of his chair and jumped for Biff. He tried
to push Biff aside, and they tangled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>&ldquo;Think you can handle him?&rdquo; a voice behind them said</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Their struggle was brief, halted by a voice from
behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you can handle him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Specks swung around. On the balcony, a
nonchalant smile on his handsome face, stood Uncle
Charlie.</p>
<p>Specks, his head pivoting from Biff to Charlie, a
frightened look in his eyes, reached for the doorknob.
He wanted out, and fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab him!&rdquo; Uncle Charlie ordered and came
charging across the room.</p>
<p>Not once so far had Uncle Charlie called Biff by
name. Biff took his lead from this. Uncle Charlie still
didn&rsquo;t want Specks to know that Biff wasn&rsquo;t Derek.</p>
<p>Biff wrapped his arms around Specks, restraining
him. Uncle Charlie, at their side, grabbed Specks by
the shoulders and wrenched him away from Biff&rsquo;s
grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how do you want to play this?&rdquo; Charles
Keene asked. His voice was firm, grim, even though
his eyes held a sparkle of amusement.</p>
<p>Specks didn&rsquo;t reply. He tried to pull away from
Uncle Charlie&rsquo;s grasp. He didn&rsquo;t have a chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several ways of handling you,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s
uncle went on. &ldquo;You see this?&rdquo; He removed one
hand and doubled it into a ham-sized fist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty
large for a sleeping tablet. But well placed, like right
here&rdquo;&mdash;he flicked Specks&rsquo; jaw with the fist&mdash;&ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m sure you will take a long, long nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Specks cowered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or, we could tie you up. But if you&rsquo;ll be a good
little Specks, and not try anything, we&rsquo;ll leave you
alone. Now get over to that chair and sit down.&rdquo;
Charlie&rsquo;s voice was angry now, and he shoved Specks
violently toward the chair.</p>
<p>Specks toppled over the chair&rsquo;s arm, shrank back in
it, and tried to make himself even smaller than he was.</p>
<p>Biff and his uncle moved over to a corner of the
room most distant from Specks and talked to one
another in low tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good to see you, Biff. Sorry I had to welcome you
this way. But things are beginning to move. I didn&rsquo;t
expect to plunge you into this up to your neck so fast,
but I think things are working out better than I had
hoped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a low voice, Biff replied, &ldquo;Uncle Charlie, just
before you came in from the balcony, there was a
knock on the door. There was another man here, too,
not so long ago. A man named Dietz. That knock
could have been him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Biff. I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who could it have been?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to the room next door and find
out,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie suggested, grinning broadly. &ldquo;Go
ahead. Specks won&rsquo;t give me any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff shrugged his shoulders, opened the door, and
stepped out into the hallway. He shook his head. That
was Uncle Charlie for you. Daring, reckless, always
making a mysterious game out of any situation. Keeping
up the suspense as long as possible.</p>
<p>Although he didn&rsquo;t always approve of his uncle&rsquo;s
methods, Biff had to admit that with Uncle Charlie,
there was never a dull moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Moments later, Biff returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; The big grin was still on Uncle Charlie&rsquo;s
face. It disappeared instantly on Biff&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one in the room next door,&rdquo; Biff said in
a quiet, steady voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here!&rdquo; Charles Keene leaped for the door.
Biff, standing in the doorway, saw him dash into the
adjoining room. He was back out in a flash. No longer
did he wear a grin. His expression was as serious as Biff
had ever seen it.</p>
<p>Charles Keene walked back to Biff, his brows knitted
in worry and anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I outsmarted myself,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was I supposed to find in the next room?&rdquo;
Biff whispered. &ldquo;Derek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was he who knocked just before I came in.
It was this way. We couldn&rsquo;t be sure how many
people might have been in this room. We knew you
were. We followed you to the hotel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you know what room I&rsquo;d be in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was easy. I&rsquo;m well known here at the Del
Mar. The clerk told me Dietz&rsquo;s room number. I took
the room next to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Dietz, then?&rdquo; Biff cut in, glancing sidewise
to make sure Specks could not overhear them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I? He&rsquo;s a bad one. Getting more and more
desperate, too. There&rsquo;s a pot of gold that he&rsquo;s afraid
we&rsquo;re going to get to first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pot of gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not literally; not actually gold. But it&rsquo;s worth
many pots of gold&mdash;big ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Uncle Charlie,&rdquo; Biff whispered. &ldquo;How did
you get over to this balcony?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ledge, not a very wide one, that joins
the balconies....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff remembered the ledge now. It wasn&rsquo;t more
than ten inches wide. His uncle had taken a dangerous
chance in crossing on that narrow ledge from
his room to this one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy, by knocking on the door, was to cause
enough distraction to give me time to cross the ledge
to this room. I was counting on the element of surprise
if I found you being held by more than two
men. Remember, surprise can add the strength of another
man to any attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when I got to your balcony and saw just
you and Specks, I knew things were going to be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t work out quite that way,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I never thought Derek would be in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now he&rsquo;s disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie nodded his head. He strode back
into the room and stood, hands on hips, glowering
down at the cowering Specks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Charlie demanded. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Dietz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Specks didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak up, or I&rsquo;ll make you talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Specks replied. His high voice
cracked as he answered. There was no doubt but that
Specks was almost numb with fear.</p>
<p>Charles Keene reached down and grabbed the man
by the shoulder. He shook him like an angry lion
shaking its kill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Keene,&rdquo; Specks begged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.
That&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Biff tugged at Uncle Charlie&rsquo;s arm, and he released
his hold on the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Charlie asked, looking into Biff&rsquo;s face.
Biff indicated with a nod of his head for his uncle to
follow him. He then went to the doorway and stood
in the hallway. His uncle came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Charlie, that man&rsquo;s too frightened of you to
talk, even if he does know where Dietz has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Keene nodded his head. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re
right, Biff. Got any ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;ve got some questions, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> think has happened to Derek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie puzzled this question a few moments
before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two things could have happened. Dietz could have
returned just as Derek knocked on the door, or when
he was returning to our room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he forced Derek to go with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That could have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t Derek have called out? Yelled for
help?&rdquo; Biff protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. You see, Biff, Derek doesn&rsquo;t
know me any better than he knows Dietz. You two
switching identities at the airport was a good joke.
But then the joke turned into a serious matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to fill Derek in on what
was actually going on,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie continued.
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t really be sure whether I&rsquo;m working for him
or against him. The same thing holds for Dietz. Dietz
is a fast and smooth talker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned that, myself,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Derek may have thought that you, by suggesting
the switch in identities, might have been in on
a plot for me to get my hands on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. It could look that way. Look, Uncle Charlie,
if you would tell me what this whole thing is all
about, I might be more help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie apparently didn&rsquo;t hear Biff&rsquo;s last remark.
He was deep in his own thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, this could have happened,&rdquo; he continued.
From his tone of voice, Biff could tell that his uncle
was more voicing his thoughts than speaking directly
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Derek might have felt that I was holding him.
And after knocking on this door, he could well have
gone right on down to the lobby intending to leave
the hotel. Dietz might have seen him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And told him you were a crook and that he would
take Derek to his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie nodded his head in agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Uncle Charlie, just where is Derek&rsquo;s
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brom Zook? I don&rsquo;t know, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dietz doesn&rsquo;t know either, does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just as Biff had reasoned. Neither his uncle
nor Dietz knew where Derek&rsquo;s father, Brom Zook,
was, and each thought the other might know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were both hoping that the other would lead
you to Brom Zook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about how it shapes up, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has Derek&rsquo;s father been missing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for over three months. The only
communication I&rsquo;ve had from him was a letter and a
package. They came two weeks after I last saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were still many questions Biff wanted to ask
his uncle. But right now, Biff figured they could wait.
The important thing was to find Derek&mdash;and Derek&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Charlie, if you think Dietz knows where
Brom Zook is, then Specks would know, too, wouldn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wouldn&rsquo;t it be best to release Specks? Tell
him he&rsquo;s free? Then we can follow Specks. If Dietz
has talked Derek into going with him, or forced him
to do so, then Specks will lead us to Dietz, Derek, and
maybe even to his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Keene thought about this for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got something there, Biff. You&rsquo;re using
your head better than I am. We&rsquo;ll do it. You go on
down to the lobby. Find a spot where you can&rsquo;t be
seen by anyone leaving the elevator. I&rsquo;ll turn Specks
loose and come down the stairs the moment he gets in
the elevator. All right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, Biff,&rdquo; his uncle called out as Biff
headed for the elevator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Crunch</span></h2>
<p>Uncle Charlie had been right about Derek.
The Dutch boy had followed Keene&rsquo;s instructions to
the letter&mdash;up to a certain point.</p>
<p>Derek had watched Charles Keene climb over the
balcony railing and onto the ledge leading to the next
room. He had held his breath as he watched the older
man press close to the building wall and inch his way
along the narrow ledge toward the next balcony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Derek had called softly.</p>
<p>Charles Keene, perspiration breaking out on his
face, nodded his head in reply.</p>
<p>Derek had gone back into the room. Moments
passed. Then he had slipped quietly out into the hallway
and moved to the next door. Then he had
knocked. He had waited a few minutes, trying to understand
the muffled words coming from the other
side of the door.</p>
<p>According to the plan, he was supposed to return
to his room and wait for Biff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Should I?&rdquo; Derek asked himself. He was even
more confused than Biff had been by the strange turn
of events. Charles Keene had seemed a pleasant
enough chap. But in the ride from the airport to the
hotel, he had been vague in some of the answers he
had given. It was hard to distrust Keene, but his explanations
had been so sketchy that Derek&rsquo;s suspicions
had been aroused.</p>
<p>He had even wondered about the switch he had
agreed to make with Biff. Why had Biff suggested the
switch? Was it only a practical joke, or was there
some deeper reason for Biff&rsquo;s suggestion?</p>
<p>What had really started Derek&rsquo;s doubts had taken
place at the airport. When Biff and the two men had
passed in the airport, Charles Keene had restrained
Derek from calling out to Biff.</p>
<p>Derek made up his mind. He would not return to
the room Keene had taken him to. If Keene wasn&rsquo;t
to be trusted, then Derek knew he would have a
much greater chance of getting away from him in the
hotel lobby than in a small room. Derek went to the
elevator. Biff had missed him by only minutes when
he went to find him.</p>
<p>In the lobby of the Del Mar, Derek took a seat with
a clear view of the elevator bank and the door to the
street. His eyes swung from one to the other. Derek
was alert, waiting for any development.</p>
<p>Once he dug his hand into the inside pocket of his
jacket. Alarm spread over his face when the object he
was feeling for wasn&rsquo;t there. He almost panicked.
Momentary relief came to him when he remembered
that he was still wearing Biff&rsquo;s sports jacket. This relief
was short-lived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The package he had reached for was of vital importance
to Derek. But Biff had swapped coats with
him. Biff now had the package containing the small
object of such value.</p>
<p>Had that been the real reason Biff had wanted to
switch identifications? So that Biff could get possession
of the package? It was hard for Derek to accept
this theory. He had developed an instant liking for
Biff. He felt that Biff had felt the same way about
him. And how could Biff have known that he,
Derek, was going to be in the airport in Miami?
Could Biff possibly have known and arranged to be
on the same plane?</p>
<p>It was too much of a puzzle for the Dutch boy.</p>
<p>Derek watched the floor indicator dial over one elevator
move, showing an elevator descending. Would
this be Biff? Or Charles Keene? The door slid open.
An elderly couple emerged.</p>
<p>He turned his glance toward the street door. A
man entered alone. He looked somewhat familiar to
Derek. Where had he seen him?</p>
<p>The man glanced swiftly about the lobby. His eyes
rested for a fraction of a second on Derek, then
turned away. The man started for the elevator. Almost
there, he stopped abruptly and swung around to
look closely at Derek. Disbelief showed in his eyes.</p>
<p>Derek recognized the man now. He had been one
of the two who had walked out of the airport terminal
building with Biff.</p>
<p>The man crossed quickly to the chair where Derek
was sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Derek! You&mdash;you escaped! I mean&mdash;tell me, what
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The man seemed confused. He was obviously unable
to believe what he saw.</p>
<p>Dietz was confused. More so even than he displayed
to Derek. How had Derek managed to get
away from Specks? What had happened in the short
space of time he had been away? He would have to
play this very cagey now. Earlier, when he had been
in the same room with this boy he could tell that the
youth had grown suspicious of him.</p>
<p>Dietz took a stab in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Keene come?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;And you got away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was true enough. Derek had gotten away
from Keene. But how did this man know that he had
been with Keene? He couldn&rsquo;t know&mdash;not yet&mdash;that
it had actually been Biff Brewster, not Derek Zook,
who had left the airport with him. Derek&rsquo;s mind
spun dizzily for a moment. &ldquo;Catch hold of yourself,&rdquo;
he said sternly to his whirling brain.</p>
<p>Derek began thinking. Both he and Dietz held their
silence for a few moments, stalling for time, each trying
to think how to learn what the other actually knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I left Mr. Keene,&rdquo; Derek finally replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there trouble? Specks&mdash;did Keene attack
him? Was that when you made your escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture was becoming clearer. The &ldquo;Specks&rdquo;
Dietz referred to must have been the other man who
had been with Biff and this man at the airport.</p>
<p>Derek had a pretty good idea now of what Dietz
must be figuring had happened. Believing Specks was
guarding the real Derek, Dietz must think that Keene
had broken in on them and overpowered Specks, and
that during the melee, he, Derek, had fled. It would be
wise, Derek thought, to find out as much as he could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>This man must be the one Keene had referred to as
Dietz. Derek decided to find this out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Dietz. That&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness you made your escape,&rdquo; Dietz
replied. &ldquo;Keene is a dangerous man. Dangerous to
you and your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was just about the same thing Keene had said
to Derek about Dietz, Derek remembered. &ldquo;Caution,&rdquo;
his brain flashed. &ldquo;Which of them is lying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father?&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;It is safe for you to
take me to him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Yes, we must leave at once. Before Keene
comes down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dietz&rsquo;s answer was quick. A bit too quick, Derek
thought. But just what or whom was he to believe?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go to him now. At once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Derek asked this question in Dutch.
This was to be the big test as to whether he would
trust this man. Derek had asked one question of Keene
in Dutch. Keene hadn&rsquo;t replied. At the time, Derek
had thought that perhaps Keene hadn&rsquo;t been listening
to him, he had been so busy telling Derek why he had
permitted Biff to leave the airport with the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is in a small hacienda to the north of
Willemstad. A half hour&rsquo;s drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dietz had replied in Dutch. Derek decided to take
a chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek didn&rsquo;t see the look of satisfaction and relief
that flashed over Dietz&rsquo;s dark features. He got up and
followed Dietz out of the hotel. Moments later, Biff
stepped out of the elevator. He just missed seeing
Dietz and Derek leave the hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Derek got into the same sleek, black limousine that
had brought Biff to the hotel only an hour before.
Dietz got behind the wheel. He wove through the
crowded streets of Willemstad. The town and its
houses and buildings looked very much like a small
waterfront town back in Holland. The houses were
the same type. Willemstad, Derek recalled, had been
named for a small village back in Holland.</p>
<p>Leaving Willemstad behind them, Dietz sped along
a narrow, winding road that climbed the foothills
toward the highest point in Cura&ccedil;ao. Suddenly he
swerved off the paved road onto an unimproved, heavily
rutted dirt road. Ten minutes more and Dietz
nosed the car through an arched opening in a pink
stone wall. Ahead, Derek could see one large, rambling
house, again stone, but painted a bright yellow,
and several smaller stone buildings.</p>
<p>Dietz stopped in front of the entrance. Immediately
there came out the largest man Derek had ever seen.
His complexion was a light coffee-brown. He wore
knee-length breeches. His legs and feet were bare. His
heavy muscles bulged beneath a thin white shirt, its
ends tied around his waist.</p>
<p>Without another glance at Derek, Dietz spoke to
the giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take over, Crunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch was well named. Derek learned this when
the man clamped a hand on his arm, grinning down at
him evilly.</p>
<p>Derek knew now that he had placed his trust in the
wrong man. But it was too late. He was powerless to
resist. Crunch had the strength to match his giant size.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Gay Cura&ccedil;ao</span></h2>
<p>Biff scanned the lobby of the hotel carefully as he
emerged from the elevator. No sign of Derek, no sign
of Dietz. They had left only minutes before Biff
reached the lobby.</p>
<p>The stairway Uncle Charlie would be coming
down, Biff noticed, led into the lobby just to the
right, and slightly behind the elevator bank. Biff decided
that behind the stairway would be the best place
for him to watch for Specks. There was a large
potted plant at the foot of the stairway. Biff got behind
it. From here, he couldn&rsquo;t be seen, yet he had a
good view of the elevators and the stairs. Specks in his
frightened haste might take the stairway. He might
not want to wait for an elevator, scared as he must be
after Uncle Charlie had given him a verbal working-over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The elevator must have been waiting on the fourth
floor, for Specks came out of it into the lobby just
after Biff had taken up his position. He saw the little
man glance nervously around the lobby. Probably,
Biff guessed, he was looking for boss Dietz. He needed
his support, needed it badly.</p>
<p>Specks then headed for the exit. He moved at a
pace so rapid that he bumped into several people who
were entering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Uncle Charlie?&rdquo; Biff asked himself. &ldquo;If he
doesn&rsquo;t get here right now, we&rsquo;ll lose Specks.&rdquo; Biff
stepped out from behind the huge plant and glanced
up the curving stairs. No Uncle Charlie. Biff did think
that he heard someone coming down, coming fast,
taking two or more steps at a time. &ldquo;That must be
he,&rdquo; Biff thought. He decided to go after Specks, hoping
his uncle would be right behind.</p>
<p>In the curved driveway outside the hotel, Biff
looked right and left. Specks must have pulled out of
there at a rapid clip. He wasn&rsquo;t in sight. Uncle Charlie
came out of the hotel, taking the three steps at a leap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he? Which way did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Biff replied. &ldquo;He was gone by the
time I got out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then.&rdquo; Uncle Charlie, on the run, headed
for the street. Biff was at his heels.</p>
<p>On the sidewalk, they tried to spot Specks.</p>
<p>It seemed to Biff he had never seen so many people
crowding the streets, all of them in a gay, holiday
mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Biff,&rdquo; Charles Keene said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d never
catch Specks in this crowd, even if we knew which
way he went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Biff replied. &ldquo;But I hate to
give up. I want to find Derek. Don&rsquo;t like the idea of
his thinking you and I are against him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know how you feel, Biff. Tell you what. Let&rsquo;s
just wander around, circulate among the crowds.
Who knows, we might bump into him. If we don&rsquo;t,
locating him is going to take time and organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff felt there would be little chance of that happening.
He knew that his uncle was just trying to
cheer him up. So, thought Biff, why not? See some of
the town at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Uncle Charlie, lead on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man and boy joined in the thronging crowd of
tourists, sight-seers, and bargain hunters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four big cruise ships in, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Cura&ccedil;ao is really hopping today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stopped at several shops. Both kept an eye out
for Derek, and Biff&rsquo;s uncle made several inquiries of
shopkeepers. No luck. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s acquaint you with this
fabulous city first, Biff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then back to the
hotel for a powwow on our next move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked over some German cameras in El
Globo on Heerenstraat. He was delighted with the
store run by Juluis Penha on Breedestraat. This store
sold dolls from all over. He bought a Dutch doll for
Monica. It was dressed in traditional Dutch clothes&mdash;wooden
shoes, a gaily colored frock, and a stiff
winged hat. He found a Swiss watch at Spritzer and
Fuhrmann, and was surprised at how inexpensive it
was. He bought it for his brother Ted and smiled as
he thought of Ted&rsquo;s face when he saw it.</p>
<p>As they walked along, Uncle Charlie kept up a
running fire of conversation, giving Biff a good picture
of life in Cura&ccedil;ao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the houses are different colors, Uncle Charlie.
Why is that?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Each house was distinct from the other, even if its
color varied by only a shade. Some were light pink,
others darker pink. There were bright green-painted
houses, and light green ones. Others were different
shades of blue and yellow.</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie chuckled before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how true this story is, Biff, but here&rsquo;s
the natives&rsquo; explanation of why the houses here are so
gaily colored. Many years ago, all the houses here
were whitewashed. It seems the unrelieved glare of
all the white houses hurt the governor&rsquo;s eyes. So,
being a powerful man who knew what he wanted, he
ordered the houses to be painted the colors of their
owners&rsquo; choices. Simple as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a governor,&rdquo; Biff replied, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you see that large building over there?&rdquo;
Uncle Charlie pointed to a magnificent structure
standing on top of a hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big enough to be a palace,&rdquo; Biff commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Franklin D. Roosevelt House, the United
States consulate. The Dutch built it up there on Ararat
Hill to express their thanks for our protection of
these Dutch islands during World War II.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was really nice of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good neighbors, the Dutch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff stopped in front of a store displaying beautiful
English china and Swedish crystal. He pretended to
be inspecting these beautiful wares. Actually he was
listening intently to a rapid-fire conversation between
two native clerks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Biff said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What don&rsquo;t you get?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;The language they&rsquo;re speaking. I thought at first
it was Spanish. I know I caught some Spanish words.
And some English words. And I could pick out some
Portuguese, too. But it&rsquo;s all so mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie laughed. &ldquo;No wonder you&rsquo;re puzzled.
They&rsquo;re speaking a language made up of more
different languages than any other in the world. It&rsquo;s
called Papiamento. The jargon is a combination of
Dutch, English, Spanish, Portuguese, African, and
Indian words. Carib Indians. A few French words
thrown in, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like Cura&ccedil;ao itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff. This island is filled with many
races although the Dutch are predominant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie looked at his watch, then glanced up
at the sun. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you getting hungry? It&rsquo;s after
noon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you remind me,&rdquo; Biff replied with a
grin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to go back to the hotel, or how about some
real Dutch-Javanese food? Dutch cooking is good.
Heavy, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead me to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie took his nephew to Koreman&rsquo;s Old
Dutch Tavern on Columbusstraat. They started out
with a delicious Dutch pea soup, for which the restaurant
is famous, and followed it with a Javanese dish of
pork and vegetables with a thick curry sauce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delicious. But, as you said&mdash;heavy. I&rsquo;m so full
now, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever want to eat again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stuff really sticks to your ribs. But if I know
you, you&rsquo;ll be starving again in a few hours. Come on,
we&rsquo;ll go back to the hotel. You must have some questions
buzzing in your brain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Uncle Charlie Spins a Yarn</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Make yourself comfortable, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie
invited, when they were back in his room at the Del
Mar. &ldquo;You must be tired. Night flight, exciting morning.
Get much sleep on the plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few hours. I think that food made me sleepier
than anything, though. Boy, am I glad to get this coat
off! Too tight for my taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff took off Derek&rsquo;s coat, which he had been wearing,
and tossed it toward a chair. As the coat landed, a
small white box fell out of the pocket. Uncle Charlie
pounced on it like a hungry cat on a mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>Charlie had taken the lid off the box and was inspecting
the object in it with a triumphant smile on
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck! I think this will clinch our case against
Dietz and Company. And at the same time, I can see
now why Derek might be very suspicious of both of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Uncle Charlie put the lid back on the box and replaced
it in Derek&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still haven&rsquo;t told me what it is,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me time. And when I do, a lot of things
will become clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Uncle Charlie is going to be mysterious again,&rdquo;
Biff said to himself. Biff sprawled out on the bed and
waited for Uncle Charlie to start talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all goes back to our days in Burma and China,
Biff. You know Explorations Unlimited still has its
headquarters in Burma. Sumatra&rsquo;s not too far from
Burma. Lots of Dutch people in Sumatra. It was once
a Dutch colony. And Explorations had done quite a
bit of work for some of the Dutch businessmen there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just after we had to get out of Burma&mdash;you remember,
of course&mdash;Explorations received an inquiry
as to whether its operations extended to the Netherlands
Antilles. Jack Hudson&mdash;you recall him, don&rsquo;t
you, Biff?&mdash;cabled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head. Jack Hudson also worked for
Explorations Unlimited. It had been Jack who had
flown into China and rescued Biff and his uncle when
Biff had taken part in the <i>Mystery of the Chinese Ring</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Jack cabled me,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie went on. &ldquo;An
inquiry had come from a friend of Derek&rsquo;s father,
Brom Zook. Brom wanted someone to work for and
with him. I got the job. I&rsquo;d picked up a seaplane with
my earnings in China and had been kicking around the
Caribbean, charter flights and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want you to do?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilot him back and forth from here to Martinique.
Run a speedboat he has in Martinique.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know from what Dietz told me that Derek&rsquo;s
father is looking for something on the bottom of the
ocean? What is it? Sunken treasure?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, yes. And he&rsquo;s found it, too. It&rsquo;s a pearl
fishery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pearl fishery!&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s voice showed his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A fabulous one. If the samples Brom has
found so far are an indication, there are millions of
dollars of pearls waiting to be taken, from a spot of
ocean floor just off the coast of Martinique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was sitting up now, leaning forward. This was
fascinating to him. Pearls, taken from the bottom of
the ocean!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the very end of November, I guess, when I
last saw Brom,&rdquo; Charles Keene said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d taken some
new skin-diving equipment over to him. He indicated
to me then that he thought he was nearing his goal.
He said I&rsquo;d hear from him within a week. I was to
come back to Cura&ccedil;ao and await word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Cura&ccedil;ao, Uncle Charlie, when he was working
in a French possession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s a Dutch citizen. Everything he does
over there has to clear through the Dutch authorities
and the French consulate here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Biff nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nearly two weeks went by. I was worried. I
flew back to Martinique. I couldn&rsquo;t locate Brom. He
had gone to sea in his speedboat, loaded with supplies.
I hung around La Trinit&eacute;&mdash;that&rsquo;s the town we headquartered
in&mdash;for a couple of days, then came back
here. Nothing else for me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie got out of his chair and walked over
to the balcony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I got a letter and a package from Brom,&rdquo;
Uncle Charlie continued. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the last I&rsquo;ve
heard from him. Oh, I&rsquo;ve been back to Martinique
several times, but he&rsquo;s vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Dietz had anything to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it, Biff. He either kidnapped Brom
Zook, and Brom got away, or he drove Brom into
hiding. It&rsquo;s just got to be one or the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dietz knew about this pearl fishery, too?&rdquo; Biff
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of people know about it, Biff. Stories of a
fabulous pearl fishery have been circulating in these
parts for years and years. The stories come from the
Carib Indians. And every once in a while, a Carib
comes to the market with a priceless pearl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no one has ever located the fishery, is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff. Many have tried, Dietz among
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does Derek fit into the picture?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. Derek is motherless. He has
spent most of his life divided between living here in
Cura&ccedil;ao with his father and living with his grandparents
in Holland. When Brom Zook started on his
hunt for the pearl fishery, he sent Derek to The Netherlands
for his schooling. He knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t
be in Cura&ccedil;ao much of the time, and he didn&rsquo;t like to
leave Derek alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Derek come back? Particularly since his
father is missing?&rdquo; The picture was still somewhat
cloudy to Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent for him,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you sent for me, too. Why both of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you look so much alike. You could easily
pass for twins.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;In Miami and on the plane, we
were taken for twins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I needed you here in the event Derek didn&rsquo;t show
up in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In time for what, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To establish his right to the pearl fishery his
father has found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff frowned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I still don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this, Biff. The letter I received from Brom
Zook, over two weeks after I last saw him, contained
a claim to a certain water area, to be filed with the
French consulate here in Willemstad, establishing
Brom Zook as the discoverer of the fishery. I was to
file it for him. Along with the letter and the claim,
I received a small package. In it was one of the most
perfect black pearls I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s eyes turned in the direction of Derek&rsquo;s coat.
He was beginning to get an idea of what Uncle
Charlie had found in the box that had tumbled from
the jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pearl was to be given the French consul
along with the claim. In the event Brom Zook didn&rsquo;t
appear within the time limit, the person appearing for
him could establish his right by presenting a black
pearl that was the perfect match for the one I left
with the consulate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that person would be Derek?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Derek get hold of the pearl?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently Brom Zook knew he was in danger,
from Dietz, I&rsquo;m sure. Dietz would try to stop him
from appearing to establish his claim&mdash;the same way
claim jumpers used to operate in the early mining
days of the old West in the United States,&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he sent Derek the other pearl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He told me he had done so in his letter.
His instructions were that if he didn&rsquo;t get in touch
with me in plenty of time before the ninety-day time
limit was to expire, then I was to cable Derek to come
at once to Cura&ccedil;ao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninety-day time limit? I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Biff
said, his voice showing he was still puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a claim is filed, such as the one I filed for
Brom Zook, there&rsquo;s a waiting period of ninety days
before the claim is granted. The law was designed to
prevent claim jumping. In those ninety days, if anyone
else can dispute the claim, then a hearing is held to
decide who discovered the find first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that if Brom Zook had jumped someone else&rsquo;s
claim, the real discoverer could protest and prove he
made the discovery first,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Biff. But in this case, Brom made
the discovery. Dietz knows it. Dietz knows that he
wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance of claiming to have made the
discovery first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t know exactly where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a pretty good idea, because I know more
precisely where Brom Zook was working than Dietz
does. You see, Biff, a claim to a water area covers a
<i>lot</i> of ocean. It isn&rsquo;t like a land claim for mining. A
mining claim covers a specific spot. A water claim
can cover an area of hundreds of acres. I know the
island group that Brom was searching in, but only
Brom knows the exact spot where the pearl oysters
are located.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then the pearl fishery itself,&rdquo; Biff said, &ldquo;could be
a very small area compared to the total area covered
by the claim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Dietz hasn&rsquo;t got a chance, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He thinks he has a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Keene grinned. &ldquo;If neither Brom Zook nor
Derek appears at the French consulate to demand the
claim within the ninety days, anyone can file for the
rights. Dietz is just waiting to file in the same general
area where the Zook claim is located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff knew now what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Brom Zook is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Biff. If neither Brom Zook nor Derek
appears, then Dietz moves in, files his claim, and then
it would be most difficult for Brom Zook to reestablish
his rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Charlie, when does that ninety-day time
limit expire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow afternoon, Biff. At four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Biff exclaimed. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve got to act
fast. We&rsquo;ve got to find Derek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Biff, we&rsquo;re still ahead of the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Brom Zook will be robbed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie said, smiling as he
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to prevent it?&rdquo; Biff demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Biff. Couldn&rsquo;t you play the role of Derek
Zook once more?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Outmatched</span></h2>
<p>Biff was taken aback by his uncle&rsquo;s last statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean if we don&rsquo;t find Derek, you want me to
substitute for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sums it up, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff shook his head. He knew he looked like Derek.
But Uncle Charlie was really asking a lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, Uncle Charlie. It&rsquo;s one thing for me to substitute
for Derek when it&rsquo;s only a joke. Like at the
airport. But to do this&mdash;this is for big stakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Biff. But, considering the fact that you
will actually be doing this so the just rights of a man
will be established, I don&rsquo;t think you would be doing
anything morally wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not. We would be stopping Dietz
from stealing what belongs to someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still&mdash;suppose I have to sign something? That
would be forgery. I couldn&rsquo;t do that, Uncle Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know you couldn&rsquo;t, Biff. And I wouldn&rsquo;t ask you
to. But I&rsquo;ve looked into this affair as closely as I can. I
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be required to sign anything. The
signing for the actual working permit to the claim will
take place in Martinique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hope you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather certain that I am, Biff. Otherwise there
wouldn&rsquo;t have been much point in my having you
come down here in such a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my being here gives you more time to find
Brom Zook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Derek, now that he is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he didn&rsquo;t get here sooner,&rdquo; Biff
pondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bet that really had me worried. I waited
until just over three weeks ago before I cabled for
Derek to come here. That would be plenty of time,
now that the Atlantic can be crossed in hours instead
of days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get a reply to your cable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That didn&rsquo;t worry me too much. I just figured
that Derek would know how serious things had
become. His father must have given him a clear picture
of the situation when he wrote him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t Derek come as soon as you cabled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a cable about ten days after I sent for Derek.
It was from his grandfather. The cable informed me
that Derek was in the Swiss Alps for winter skiing.
The grandfather had tried and tried to locate him. It
seems Derek was off on a long cross-country ski race.
You know, where the winner is the one who covers
the most miles in a given number of days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be hard to locate someone on one of those jaunts,
all right,&rdquo; Biff agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;So, being desperate, and not knowing if Derek
would get here before the time limit expired, I cabled
for you. And was I ever glad to see you come through
the door of the terminal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you actually had the real Derek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But from the
way things have gone, it&rsquo;s a good thing I do have two
Dereks.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The hands on the clock in the hearing room of the
French consulate showed fifteen minutes of four.
Seated in the first of the row of benches which lined
the room were Herman Dietz and Specks Cade. Dietz
wore a satisfied smile on his face. Things were going
fine. Just fine. Fifteen more minutes, and Brom Zook&rsquo;s
claim would be worthless, voided by the expiration of
the ninety-day time limit.</p>
<p>Specks&rsquo;s feelings were just the opposite of Dietz&rsquo;s.
He was nervous. He kept shifting back and forth on
the bench, looking at the entrance, watching the clock.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of four.</p>
<p>The claims referee finished some business with the
only other person left in the room. He looked down
from his bench at Dietz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have business with the Claims Division?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I have a claim to file.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s have it. It grows late,&rdquo; the referee said
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will when it becomes four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Dietz said.
&ldquo;It would not be proper for me to file my claim when
there is still time for my friend Brom Zook to appear
to ask for his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The referee looked down at the paper in front of
him. He picked it up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Brom Zook. I have it here.&rdquo; He glanced
at the clock.</p>
<p>Five minutes to four.</p>
<p>A dead silence came over the hearing room. Three
men kept their eyes on the clock. Even Dietz fidgeted
somewhat as the minute hand came nearer and nearer
to the hour hand. Only three minutes and he would
win.</p>
<p>The sound of feet striding briskly and firmly came
from the rear of the room. Dietz swung around. His
face went white. His heart pounded. It couldn&rsquo;t be. It
was impossible! Derek Zook was a prisoner guarded
by Crunch. Crunch was a simple-minded soul, but a
powerful man. Derek Zook couldn&rsquo;t have escaped!</p>
<p>Biff Brewster came striding down the aisle.</p>
<p>The referee looked up. &ldquo;And what is the matter
concerning you that brings you before this Claims
Division?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter of the claim to a pearl fishery, made
by Brom Zook of Cura&ccedil;ao, sir,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>The referee picked up some papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can establish your right to the claim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head.</p>
<p>Charles Keene came down the aisle and stood by
his nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see by a letter which accompanies this claim that
you must meet a certain requirement in order to establish
your right beyond any doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff cast a quick glance at his uncle. Charles Keene
said nothing. The clerk went on:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brom Zook has accompanied his filing of a claim
asking to be granted the rights to fish for pearls in
certain waters off the Island of Martinique, with an
object which must be matched by any claimant other
than himself. Since I know you are not Brom Zook,
you must present this object to establish yourself as
the rightful claimant to the grant. You have it, young
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Momentarily Biff panicked. Where had he put the
pearl? Then he felt his uncle nudge him. &ldquo;Your inside
coat pocket, Biff,&rdquo; Charles Keene whispered.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s hand shot into his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The object referred to,&rdquo; the referee went on, &ldquo;is a
pearl. A black pearl that must match perfectly the one
I hold here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, Dietz raised an eyebrow and
smirked. He was positive no such pearl existed. If it
did, Derek didn&rsquo;t have it. He had searched Derek
carefully. No pearl had been found.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s hand touched the small box. He pulled it out
and stepped forward to the referee&rsquo;s bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir.&rdquo; Biff said, holding the beautiful pearl in
the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>The referee took it. Biff couldn&rsquo;t resist turning
around to see Dietz&rsquo;s reaction. Dietz was grasping
Specks&rsquo;s arm. He seemed about to faint. He swallowed
several times, shaking his head as if trying to
remove from his vision something he couldn&rsquo;t believe
he was seeing.</p>
<p>The referee was examining the two pearls closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems to be in order. There can be no
doubt that these are matching pearls. Beautiful ones,
too. My congratulations to you, young man, and to
your father. He has truly made a discovery of great
beauty and value.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The referee placed the papers in a thick manila
envelope and handed them over to Biff. &ldquo;And now,
seeing that no one else is here to present a claim, I declare
the Claims Division closed for the day,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Biff joined his uncle, and the two strode happily
toward the exit. At the door, they turned and looked
back. Dietz was slumped back against the bench.
Specks hovered over him like a nervous mother hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Plan of Action</span></h2>
<p>Two happier people couldn&rsquo;t be found among the
gay crowds of tourists swarming the streets of Willemstad
than Biff Brewster and Charlie Keene. They
were standing at the bottom of the steps leading from
the French consulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We pulled it off, Biff. We really outfoxed Dietz,&rdquo;
Charlie said exultantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure did. But I was kind of shaky in there for a
few moments. I mean when the referee asked about
the matching pearl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie laughed. &ldquo;You felt like the best man
at the wedding who forgot where he had put the ring,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and his uncle had spent all their time before appearing
at the Claims Division in looking for Derek.
They had gone to the Zook home, long closed since
Brom Zook had been in Martinique and Derek in Holland.
They thought the boy might have gone there to
hide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>They had also inquired at a small boarding house
where Brom Zook had stayed on his infrequent trips to
Cura&ccedil;ao. No sign or word of Derek anywhere. They
had come to the conclusion that Dietz must be holding
the Dutch boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, Biff, we&rsquo;ve established Brom Zook&rsquo;s rights to
the claim, and we&rsquo;ve got the matching pearls. Pretty
good day&rsquo;s work, I&rsquo;d say. Couldn&rsquo;t have done it
without you, though. My compliments to you, Biff-Derek-Zook-Brewster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get back to being just
Biff Brewster again. Impersonating Derek Zook gets
pretty rough at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie wasn&rsquo;t listening. Biff had given him
the papers establishing the claim and the two pearls.
Uncle Charlie was examining the pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real beauties, aren&rsquo;t they? And valuable, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think they&rsquo;re worth, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm ... several thousand dollars at least.
They&rsquo;d make a perfect pair of earrings for some exotic
movie star or Italian countess or a member of the
British nobility. Not worth a big fortune, but a considerable
one. A pearl collector would probably want
them at any price named.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s plenty more where they came from,&rdquo;
Biff suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, there are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was quiet. His thoughts were now back on
Derek. True, he and his uncle had preserved Derek
and his father&rsquo;s pearl fishery claim, but unless they
could find Derek and Brom Zook, what they had done
so far was valueless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Charlie, we&rsquo;ve just got to find Derek now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Keene frowned. &ldquo;I know it, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let Dietz find out that it wasn&rsquo;t Derek
who appeared before the claims referee. If he does,
he could upset our applecart but good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And it still has to be the real Derek who signs
for the working permit in Martinique. Your impersonation
can&rsquo;t go to the extreme of signing Derek&rsquo;s
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff glanced down the street. His eyes came to rest
on the sleek, black limousine which had brought Dietz
to the Claims Division. It was the same car in which
Biff had ridden from the airport to the hotel. Looking
at it gave Biff an idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Uncle Charlie. If Dietz did get Derek, he
must still be holding him. Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His uncle nodded his head in agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although he doesn&rsquo;t know it, of course, since
he saw me in the Claims office, and thought I was
Derek&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Biff, I think I&rsquo;m reading you louder and
your upcoming idea is getting clearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking, as he must be, that Derek somehow
escaped, wouldn&rsquo;t he let his guard down now? He
must figure the game is almost up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d figure it myself,&rdquo; Charlie replied.
&ldquo;And how wrong I&rsquo;d be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. So, believing Derek must have escaped,
wouldn&rsquo;t Dietz feel it no longer necessary to take any
precautions in returning to his hide-out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get you, Biff. Following him ought to be a cinch
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for then? Let&rsquo;s get in your
car and wait for Dietz and Specks to come out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The two walked over to Charlie Keene&rsquo;s small,
low-slung, two-seater sports car. They climbed in
and waited. Keene&rsquo;s car was parked four cars removed
from the black limousine. The cars intervening
gave Biff and his uncle a good spot from which
to observe, without too much chance of being seen
themselves.</p>
<p>Five minutes passed before a dejected Dietz and his
pal Specks came out of the building. They got into the
limousine, Specks at the wheel, and pulled away.
Uncle Charlie started up his car and slipped into the
thick traffic behind. There was little chance of their
pursuing car being noticed by Dietz in the crowded
downtown streets.</p>
<p>As Dietz&rsquo;s limousine reached the northern outskirts
of the city, traffic thinned. Charlie dropped back
half a block, still keeping the black car within easy
vision.</p>
<p>Once the city was left behind, Specks speeded up.
The limousine roared along the road. Charlie let it
pull away although he didn&rsquo;t have to. His sports car
was much the faster of the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid we&rsquo;ll lose him, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo;
Biff asked, worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance, Biff. This road goes only one place.
The end of the island. No major turnoffs. If we
stick too close on his tail, he might spot us. I just want
to keep the car in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They remained a good half mile behind the black
car. Each time it rounded a curve and disappeared
from sight, Biff&rsquo;s worries increased. But each time, as
his uncle rounded the same curve, Biff was relieved to
see the black car ahead. Charlie kept the same distance
between the cars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Uncle Charlie,&rdquo; Biff cried out suddenly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s turning off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Keene nodded his head and tramped down
heavily on the accelerator. The sports car leaped
ahead. It roared down the road, rapidly closing the
gap to the spot the black car had turned off. As they
neared it, Charlie slowed. They came to a jagged
road, angling off to the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where they turned,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>Charlie nodded his head, but kept on going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to turn in?&rdquo; Biff asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not right away. We&rsquo;re too close behind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie continued on down the paved road for a
quarter of a mile, then U-turned and came back. He
cut to the left into the rough road they had just
passed, pulled up, and cut his motor.</p>
<p>Biff and Charlie got out. Charlie went ahead, inspecting
the road. It was composed of sand and
crushed shells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it, Biff. I&rsquo;m positive. See those deep tracks?
Hasn&rsquo;t been time for the sand to have shifted and run
back to fill them in. These roads with sand show
tracks much as a snow-covered road does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was convinced. Not only by his uncle&rsquo;s skill at
picking out fresh tracks, but because he hadn&rsquo;t seen
any other road in that vicinity. It had to be the road
the black car had just turned down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s figure our next move, Biff,&rdquo; Charlie said.
The two got back into the sports car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know where we are. There used to be a
big estate somewhere around here. It&rsquo;s been closed up
for some years. There&rsquo;s one large house, a hacienda,
and several smaller outbuildings. An ideal place to
hide out, particularly if you wanted to hold someone
prisoner. Let&rsquo;s put our plotting machine to work for a
few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, Biff was all for barging right ahead, crashing
right in and demanding of Dietz the whereabouts
of Derek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d better do that, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know how many cohorts
Dietz might have. He&rsquo;s bound to have a servant or
two. Particularly since he had to have someone to
keep a sharp eye on Derek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean, Uncle Charlie. What&rsquo;s your
plan of action?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up to the hacienda by myself. I can keep
Dietz plenty busy with questions and accusations for
a while. That will give you time to scout around the
outbuildings and search for Derek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t Dietz want to find out how Derek got
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But since Dietz thinks he is gone, what
good will it do him to worry about locking the gate
now that his prize has fled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded his head. Then another thought came
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t the guard who let Derek get away be
so worried and scared he&rsquo;ll report to Dietz at once?&rdquo;
Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, there, my boy. You&rsquo;re beginning to think
like Dietz. Why should the guard be upset? He still
has Derek, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot, Uncle Charlie,&rdquo; Biff said sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s move on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>They drove for about two miles along the winding
sand-shell road until they came to the arched opening
in the pink-stone wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where we part for a while,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive on up to the hacienda. You wait until
you see me enter. Then make like a beagle and sniff
out the other buildings fast.&rdquo; Charlie looked at his
watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got six-fifteen. How &rsquo;bout you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Biff. We&rsquo;ll rendezvous outside this gate at
exactly six forty-five. It will still be light by then. But
darkness comes fast. Night falls as fast as a theater
curtain in the tropics. One minute it&rsquo;s daylight. The
next it&rsquo;s dark. Dusk lasts about one minute. All set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. And I hope you see double when we rendezvous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See double?&rdquo; Uncle Charlie was momentarily
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Derek <i>and</i> me,&rdquo; Biff said, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. I get you. Guess I&rsquo;d stopped thinking clearly
for a moment this time. Good luck, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Keene started the car and drove toward the
hacienda.</p>
<p>Biff waited until he saw him enter the building.
When the door closed behind his uncle, Biff, keeping
close to the wall, started out on his bird-dogging
expedition.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Biff, the grounds had been landscaped.
Palm trees, low palmetto bushes, and flower
gardens, now filled with rank, weedy growth, gave
him plenty of cover to scout around.</p>
<p>The first two buildings he inspected were empty.
A third, smaller building, well removed from the
main house, looked like the next likely place. As Biff
approached it, he noticed that the windows of the
building were barred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1148" />
<p class="caption"><i>Biff noticed that the windows of the building were barred</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Biff crept silently up to the building. He pressed
close to the wall of the stone house and worked his
way around to its rear. Cautiously he raised his head
until his eyes were at the level of the window. He
looked into the room.</p>
<p>Once more he was looking at himself in a mirror.
This time Derek&rsquo;s expression was even more startled
than when the two boys had first met at the Miami
airport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Biff Meets Crunch</span></h2>
<p>Biff quickly pressed a forefinger against his lips. If
Derek, startled as he was, made an outcry, any chance
of freeing him would be gone.</p>
<p>Derek was seated on the edge of a small cot. The
only other furniture in the room was a straight chair.
Biff could see through a narrow opening into the second
of the two rooms which made up the small stone
house. The entrance to this house-prison must be in
the other room, Biff figured.</p>
<p>Derek arose and came quietly to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff! You found me!&rdquo; Derek sounded as if he
couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got to get you out of here. Fast,&rdquo; Biff
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me, Biff, what has happened? I&rsquo;m all confused.
I have to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time now,&rdquo; Biff replied. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t get you out
of here right away, you&rsquo;ll be in real trouble. Are you
alone here, or are you being guarded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a guard right in the other room,&rdquo; Derek
whispered back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s face fell. He had expected Derek to be under
guard, but he&rsquo;d hoped the guard wouldn&rsquo;t be so close
by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way of slipping past him, I suppose?&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have little or no chance. The guard is a
giant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been treated all right?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. The guard, while big enough to crush me
with his bare hands, is really quite a simple soul. He&rsquo;s
friendly too, as long as I don&rsquo;t try anything,&rdquo; Derek
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he stays here all the time? Never leaves you
alone?&rdquo; Biff pressed his questions hurriedly. There
wasn&rsquo;t much time before he was to rejoin his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Biff. He goes to the main house for my meals
and his.&rdquo; Derek looked at his watch. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be going
any minute now. At six-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be sure he&rsquo;ll go at six-thirty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek grinned. &ldquo;It would be funny if I weren&rsquo;t a
prisoner. My guard&mdash;his name is Crunch&mdash;can&rsquo;t read.
Can&rsquo;t even tell time. He has me set an alarm clock for
when it&rsquo;s time for him to go get our food. When the
alarm goes off, we eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you set it for six-thirty.&rdquo; Biff said this half
aloud. His thoughts were racing as a plan was shaping
up in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen closely, Derek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dutch boy grasped the iron bars of the window
in his hands and pulled himself nearer to Biff.
Their heads were only inches apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember an arched gateway leading into
this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to meet my Uncle Charlie there at six forty-five.
He&rsquo;s up at the hacienda, stalling Dietz. Here&rsquo;s my
plan. It ought to work, too, if Crunch is as simple-minded
as you say he is.&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s voice was a low, rapid
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it will work, Derek?&rdquo; he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should. I just hope you don&rsquo;t get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about me. You just make for
that gate as fast as you can if you get out. Wait for my
uncle. If I&rsquo;m not there by the time you two meet,
both of you go on ahead. Forget about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek&rsquo;s frown showed that he didn&rsquo;t like the possibility
that Biff might get caught. His &ldquo;But Biff&mdash;&rdquo;
was cut short by the sharp ringing of an alarm clock
bell.</p>
<p>Biff pulled quickly away from the window. He
moved quietly but speedily until he stood concealed
just behind the front wall of the small building. He
poked his head around the corner, saw the doorway
only six feet away, then drew back.</p>
<p>Moments passed. Biff heard the sound of a key grating
in a lock. Again he poked his head cautiously
around the corner of the building. He saw the door
swing outward. Next he saw the guard come out.
Biff gasped. Never had he seen a man of such tremendous
size. Derek was right. This man was a giant! Big
powerful shoulders topped a strong, barrel-shaped
torso. His large head, thatched with shaggy hair, was
out-size even on so massive a body. Biff shuddered
to think what his fate might be if Crunch ever got
his hands on him. And that was just what might happen.
Biff was going to deliberately try to get Crunch
to attack him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Crunch swung the door closed. He started to put
the key back in the lock. Biff acted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use locking the door, Crunch,&rdquo; he said, hoping
the big man would not notice he was not dressed like
Derek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch, startled, turned in Biff&rsquo;s direction. He
stared with his mouth agape like a child seeing something
for the first time; seeing something that just
couldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Crunch, I got out the back window,&rdquo; Biff
said.</p>
<p>Crunch turned bewilderedly to look through the
door, as if expecting to see Biff in the act of escaping.
He turned his head back to Biff. Biff took a step back.
He cringed, pretending to be frightened. Actually, he
didn&rsquo;t have to pretend too much. The size of the man
alone was enough to frighten anyone.</p>
<p>Crunch was still confused. He took a step toward
Biff, then looked back at the unlocked door. He made
a motion as if he were going to lock it.</p>
<p>Biff withdrew another few feet. He wanted the big
man to chase him. It took Crunch a little time to figure
out the situation. Then, as he saw Biff move farther
away from him, he made up his mind. He lunged toward
Biff. Biff turned and ran.</p>
<p>The plan was working out fine. Derek would have
plenty of time and opportunity to get out of his jail
and head for the gateway.</p>
<p>Everything was fine with one exception. Suppose
Crunch overtook Biff? The boy could almost feel
the massive arms of the giant closing around him.
Crunch&rsquo;s grasp would be as powerful as that of a boa
constrictor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Running in the mixture of sand and shell was difficult.
Biff felt he was making no progress. It was like
racing on a treadmill. Running was even harder for
the giant. His long strides, his great weight forced his
feet deep into the soft under-footing, slowing him
more than it did Biff.</p>
<p>Biff had headed directly away from the big house
and Derek&rsquo;s recent prison. He wanted to draw
Crunch as far away as possible.</p>
<p>Biff could still hear the big man pounding after
him. The distance between them was widening. Biff
halted, took refuge behind a thick palmetto bush and
waited. He could hear Crunch coming on. As he came
nearer, the big man&rsquo;s breathing was loud. He was
gasping for breath. The sand was his real enemy. It
held him back, sapped him of his great strength.</p>
<p>Crunch passed within a few feet of where Biff was
hiding. He continued at a staggering run. When Biff
felt he was a hundred or more feet away, he crept out
from beneath his sheltering bush and struck out for
the gateway.</p>
<p>Biff glanced at his watch. It was already six forty-five.
Had Derek made it? Had Uncle Charlie been
able to get away without Dietz&rsquo;s watching him? If he
had, then he and Derek already would have met.</p>
<p>Suddenly it began to grow darker. Biff welcomed
the quick nightfall. It gave him more cover. When he
reached the gate, he welcomed the darkness even
more.</p>
<p>Derek and Uncle Charlie were gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Double Chance</span></h2>
<p>The sudden nightfall, the quick spread of darkness,
was most fortunate for Biff. He selected a secluded
spot not far from the arched gateway and holed in to
catch his breath and figure out his next move.</p>
<p>Biff was very well pleased with the way he had
tricked the giant Crunch. Derek had escaped. He
must have met Uncle Charlie. The problem now was&mdash;how
was Biff going to rejoin them?</p>
<p>As he sat on the warm sand, wondering if he should
start the long walk back to Willemstad, he heard
shouts and angry voices coming from the main house.</p>
<p>A knife of light cut into the darkness as the door
opened. Out at a run came Dietz, Specks, and Crunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the car, Specks,&rdquo; Dietz&rsquo;s order rang out.
&ldquo;Crunch and I will search the grounds. Meet us at the
gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s first idea at hearing the words was to move
out fast, put as much distance as possible between him
and the main house and the searchers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Then a second idea came to him. It was a daring
idea. It was a dangerous one. He decided to wait and
see if he could put his plan into effect.</p>
<p>Two sweeping streaks of light told Biff that Specks
was on his way to the gate in the car. It pulled up and
stopped just outside the gate, not more than ten feet
from Biff&rsquo;s place of concealment.</p>
<p>Biff could hear Dietz and Crunch thrashing about
in the underbrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff heard Dietz shout.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not here. Come on to the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moments later Biff saw Dietz join Specks by the
front of the car. They stood in the glare of its headlights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stupid fool!&rdquo; Dietz said angrily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether to believe him or not. Do you think he
was seeing things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, boss, Crunch is stupid. He&rsquo;s <i>too</i> stupid to
dream up a story like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right. But why would that Zook
kid come back here after he had escaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got me, boss. Unless he hid something there
and came back for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What would he have left when he got
away? It just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff smiled at Dietz&rsquo;s confusion. &ldquo;It sure doesn&rsquo;t
make sense&mdash;to you, Mr. Dietz,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t get Keene&rsquo;s coming out here,&rdquo; Dietz
went on. &ldquo;He certainly doesn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d tell him
where Brom Zook is. He&rsquo;s not that dumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t tell him even if you knew,&rdquo;
Specks replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>That was a piece of information valuable to Biff.
Now he knew for certain that Dietz didn&rsquo;t know
where Derek&rsquo;s father was. Nobody seemed to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty tough on Derek,&rdquo; Biff said to himself.</p>
<p>The giant Crunch came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in, you big lug,&rdquo; Dietz commanded. &ldquo;In the
front, stupid, with Specks.&rdquo; There was anger in Dietz&rsquo;s
voice. But no fear. Biff wondered why the giant
Carib Indian stood such verbal abuse. He could tear
Dietz apart.</p>
<p>Dietz climbed in, and Specks put the car in gear. It
started off slowly. Biff went into action. Doubled up,
running low, he overtook the car, hopped onto the
rear bumper, and grasped the trunk handle. This was
a dangerous thing to do. Biff realized it. But what better
chance did he have of getting away, and getting
away fast?</p>
<p>Biff appreciated the humor of the situation, too.
Here was Dietz out looking for him, and all the time
only the length of the limousine&rsquo;s trunk lid separated
the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My enemy is giving me a lift to town,&rdquo; Biff
chuckled. &ldquo;Darned nice of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff had to hold on tight as the car gained speed. It
lurched and careened around the sharp turns of the
curving road. By the time Specks reached the paved
highway, Biff had had enough. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t
be hurt too much if he were thrown off the car on the
sand road. But if he fell off on a paved highway with
the car going at high speed, he could be seriously injured.</p>
<p>He also realized that a following car would spot
him easily, hanging onto the trunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>As Specks slowed to turn onto the main highway,
Biff dropped off the car and skipped over to the side
of the road. The limousine headed for Willemstad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; Biff asked himself. &ldquo;Do they pick up
hitchhikers in Cura&ccedil;ao?&rdquo; He walked out to the main
road. He was just in time to see the taillights of the
limousine disappear as the car rounded a curve.</p>
<p>Biff was startled by the sound of another car starting,
just a short distance up the road in the opposite
direction from Willemstad. The car&rsquo;s lights came on.
It headed toward Biff. Biff stepped back into the
darkness. The car came at the dirt road gaining speed.
Its tires screeched as the driver cut sharply off the
paved road onto the dirt one.</p>
<p>Biff recognized the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Uncle Charlie!&rdquo; Biff shouted at the top of
his voice as the sports car shot passed him. At first,
Biff didn&rsquo;t think his shout had been heard over the
sound of the car&rsquo;s engine. Then the car braked
sharply. Biff ran up to it.</p>
<p>Charlie Keene hopped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay, Biff? Crunch didn&rsquo;t get you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See for yourself, Uncle Charlie. I got away all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million thanks to you, Biff. And a million more
pardons for my ever having suspected you or your
uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Derek. I don&rsquo;t blame you for being suspicious.
How could you help it when I even had your
pearl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Biff, to be truthful, I did think for a while
that maybe the real reason you wanted me to impersonate
you at the airport was so you could get my
coat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one joke I won&rsquo;t be trying again for a long,
long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It turned out for the good, though, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Derek replied. &ldquo;Dietz still doesn&rsquo;t know there are two
of us. Either two Dereks or two Biffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know I&rsquo;d be here?&rdquo; Biff asked his
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, Biff. I was afraid Crunch might have
caught you. So was Derek. I was pretty sure that
Dietz would head back for Willemstad as soon as I
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you so sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Dietz that I&rsquo;d left Derek there. If Dietz can
prevent Derek from getting to Martinique, he still has
a chance to jump the Zook claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have to sign the permit for the working
permit, Biff,&rdquo; Derek said.</p>
<p>Biff was thinking fast. Another plan was developing
in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Uncle Charlie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;If you and Derek
could get to Martinique without Dietz, it would be a
good break, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best ever, Biff. What&rsquo;ve you got in mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I take Derek&rsquo;s place again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Biff. You can&rsquo;t sign those papers. That
would be forgery,&rdquo; Charles Keene reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;d go to Martinique,&rdquo; Biff
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you getting at?&rdquo; Uncle Charlie demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I go back to the hacienda? When Dietz
and Company return, Dietz will think he still has
Derek under his thumb, and that would give you and
Derek plenty of time to get set up in Martinique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie didn&rsquo;t reply at once. He was considering
Biff&rsquo;s daring plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like it, Biff. It would work out well for
us, sure. But you might get hurt. I&rsquo;m thinking of
Crunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on now, Uncle Charlie. I&rsquo;ve been in
tighter spots than the one I&rsquo;ve described.&rdquo; Biff spoke
boldly, confidently. His inner feelings didn&rsquo;t match
his spoken optimism. &ldquo;Derek tells me Crunch is really
a gentle person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except when he&rsquo;s aroused,&rdquo; Derek cut in. &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t harm me. Not once. But one time when I tried
to follow him when he went for our meals, he picked
me up and threw me on the cot as if I were a small
puppy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, Uncle Charlie, I have no intention of
antagonizing Crunch,&rdquo; Biff assured him. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll
think up some reason for being there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie rubbed his jaw. &ldquo;Well, Biff, I still
don&rsquo;t like the idea at all. But it surely would give us
the time we need. We&rsquo;ve got to get the working permit.
And I&rsquo;ve got to fuel my seaplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re weakening, aren&rsquo;t you, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am, Biff. I&rsquo;ll come back for you in a couple
of days. Dietz will free you once I convince him
you aren&rsquo;t the real Derek Zook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. We&rsquo;ll do it then. But before I go back to
the hacienda and surrender myself, I could use some
<span class="sc">FOOD</span>! How about you, Derek? Hungry? You missed
your nightly feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know an eating place not too far from here,&rdquo;
Uncle Charlie said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Dietz won&rsquo;t be back for
a couple of hours anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour and a half later, Uncle Charlie and Derek
dropped Biff off at the sand-shell road leading to the
hacienda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of luck, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie said, placing an
affectionate hand on his nephew&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best wishes go with you, too, Biff,&rdquo; Derek
said, holding out his hand. &ldquo;And my thanks for all you
have done and are going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff watched the sports car head toward Cura&ccedil;ao.
Then he turned and walked down the starlit road. He
didn&rsquo;t feel quite so brave with his uncle and Derek
gone. He couldn&rsquo;t know how Dietz would react
when he discovered &ldquo;Derek&rdquo; had again walked right
back into the trap. Biff did think that he had a good
story as his explanation for returning. It was a story
he felt sure would prevent Dietz from harming him.</p>
<p>Once again, Biff&rsquo;s plan was going to backfire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Turnabout</span></h2>
<p>Biff walked along the lonely, winding road, alert,
ears tuned for any sound, and admitting frankly to
himself that his nerves were on edge. It was nearly
eleven o&rsquo;clock by the time he reached the gate. The
only light at the house was the single, bare bulb
illuminating the front porch.</p>
<p>Was Dietz back? Had they all gone to bed? Biff
didn&rsquo;t think so. He slipped through the gate. Keeping
in the shadows as much as possible, he went up to
the house. He couldn&rsquo;t hear a sound from within.
He moved around to the rear, peeking through every
window he passed. Nothing stirred. The silence was
creepy. Biff felt he would welcome even Dietz. Now
that he had decided on this course, he wanted to get
started. He wanted to see Dietz&rsquo;s reaction when
&ldquo;Derek&rdquo; delivered himself into the hands of his enemy.</p>
<p>The sound of a car came to Biff&rsquo;s ears from a
distance. He ran swiftly back to the gateway, and
scurried into the hiding place in which he had concealed
himself before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Just in time, too. The black limousine came up the
road, passed through the gate, and drew up in front
of the porch. Dietz got out. Crunch got out. Biff
could see Dietz speak to Crunch. The big Indian
bowed his head and walked off in the direction of the
small house where Biff had first seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Biff said half aloud. &ldquo;At least, I won&rsquo;t
have to worry about Crunch being present when I
go up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited a few minutes more. Specks returned
from parking the car, joined Dietz, who had waited
on the porch, and the two men entered the house.
The porch light went off. Lights inside the house
came on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s now or never. This is it, Biff Brewster.
Get hold of yourself and start moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff crossed the yard again and mounted the steps
leading to the porch. His heart was pounding. He
swallowed, but the lump in his throat stayed where
it was. Biff&rsquo;s knuckles rapped on the door. He stepped
back. He heard footsteps approaching. The door
opened. It was Specks.</p>
<p>Specks&rsquo; mouth dropped open in amazement. His
face went pale. The red blotches on his cheeks became
even redder against the whiteness of his skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, Specks?&rdquo; Biff heard Dietz call.</p>
<p>Specks didn&rsquo;t answer. He was speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Dietz called again. &ldquo;What is it?
Specks!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>As he stepped inside the house, Specks took a step
backward. He must have thought he was seeing a
ghost. Just then Dietz came into the hallway. He took
one look at Biff, and the glass he was holding in one
hand dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zook! Derek Zook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dietz was as astonished as Specks. But being
quicker-witted than his partner, Dietz got over his
amazement faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Zook. Grab him, Specks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be necessary, Mr. Dietz,&rdquo; Biff said
boldly. &ldquo;I have come here on my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still not believing what he saw or heard, Dietz
came up to Biff. He placed a hand on Biff&rsquo;s arm, as
though trying to assure himself that the boy was
real.</p>
<p>Biff brushed past the two men and walked down
the hallway to a door which led into a living room.
He walked in, picked out a comfortable chair, and
sat down in it as calmly as if he were in his own
home in Indianapolis.</p>
<p>Still somewhat dazed, Dietz entered the room and
stared at Biff. Specks stood in the doorway, shaking
his head.</p>
<p>Dietz recovered his poise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here? Why have you come
back?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be fun,&rdquo; Biff thought. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
know I was going to knock them for this much of a
loop.&rdquo; Aloud, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;you mean all the time we were in
Willemstad looking for you, you were right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the time,&rdquo; Biff answered truthfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go get Crunch,&rdquo; Dietz ordered Specks. A gleam
had come into his eyes. He was getting ready to take
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you tell me why you have come back here,&rdquo;
Dietz said to Biff, and walked over to the chair where
Biff was sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want information,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;I want to know
where my father is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do. And you think I&rsquo;ll tell you just for
the asking.&rdquo; Dietz&rsquo;s laugh was more of a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be able to make a bargain,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>Dietz leaned forward. A hungry look spread over
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean if I tell you where your father is&mdash;&rdquo; he
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might persuade him to cut you in on the pearl
fishery. That&rsquo;s what you want, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dietz didn&rsquo;t reply. He walked across the room and
stood by a long, low table. His hand went to his head.
He rubbed his scalp. His long silence worried Biff. It
was obvious that some scheme was forming in Dietz&rsquo;s
mind. He came back to Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you where your father is if you&rsquo;ll tell me
the exact location of the pearl fishery.&rdquo; Dietz poked
his crafty face close to Biff&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Biff could hardly suppress a smile. He knew that
neither one of them could give the other the information
asked for. Biff didn&rsquo;t know where the pearl
fishery was. He also knew that Dietz didn&rsquo;t know
where Brom Zook was. This was going to be a cat-and-mouse
game. Biff just hoped it could be played
long enough for his uncle and Derek to get things
firmed up in Martinique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you take me to my father?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not until you give me the information I want,&rdquo;
Dietz replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here in Cura&ccedil;ao, or in Martinique?&rdquo; Biff asked
this question to stall for more time. He knew Dietz
couldn&rsquo;t give him an honest answer.</p>
<p>Before Dietz could reply, Specks returned. The
giant Crunch was behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, young man, you&rsquo;ll find out just what a fool
you were not to stay away from here once you
had made your escape,&rdquo; Dietz declared.</p>
<p>The tide was running against Biff. There was a
look of triumph on Dietz&rsquo;s evil face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here with a fair proposition for you,&rdquo; Biff
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair? Never heard the word,&rdquo; Dietz replied, his
voice scornful. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve walked and talked yourself
right into being my prisoner again. And this time,
Crunch will make sure you don&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked at the powerful Crunch. There was a
big, silly smile on his face. He clenched and unclenched
his hands, as if he could hardly wait to get
Biff in his grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young fool,&rdquo; Dietz said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know
you and Keene can&rsquo;t get the working permit to that
fishery unless you sign for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But neither can you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! That&rsquo;s what you think. It so happens, you
stupid boy, that I have a friend in the Fisheries Commission
on Martinique. You and Keene may have
stopped me once. But you won&rsquo;t again. Crunch, take
him away. And this time, if you let him escape&mdash;&rdquo;
Dietz drew the edge of his hand across his throat &ldquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what you&rsquo;ll get.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Crunch crossed to Biff&rsquo;s chair. He seized Biff by
one arm and lifted him out of the chair as if he
weighed no more than a rag doll.</p>
<p>Biff knew it would be foolish to resist. His plan
had backfired.</p>
<p>Why, he thought, with a sinking feeling, hadn&rsquo;t
he or Uncle Charlie realized that Dietz, thinking Biff
to be Derek, would hold him, and make for Martinique
as fast as he could? Biff realized now that,
far from delaying Dietz&rsquo;s trip to Martinique, he had
afforded him the chance to go there sooner.</p>
<p>He knew this all too well as Crunch forced him
down the hallway toward the door. He heard Dietz
say to Specks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We leave for Martinique in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Talk with Crunch</span></h2>
<p>Although Biff&rsquo;s strategy had backfired, it did
give his uncle a slight jump on Dietz.</p>
<p>Just after daybreak, Charlie Keene and Derek were
at the waterport where Keene kept his seaplane. He
warmed up the plane&rsquo;s twin engines. He pointed the
plane&rsquo;s nose into the wind, and the aircraft streaked
across mirror-flat water. The seal between plane&rsquo;s
hull and the sea was broken, and the plane was airborne.</p>
<p>Charlie Keene put the plane on a course direct for
Martinique, a little over five hundred miles away. If
all went well, they would land at Fort-de-France in
under three hours. That would get them there in
time for the opening of the office of the Fisheries
Commission.</p>
<p>Dietz wouldn&rsquo;t be able to leave until the commercial
flight at 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> He wouldn&rsquo;t get to Martinique
until noon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Biff&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Derek said to Biff&rsquo;s uncle.
The plane was high over the sparkling waters of the
Caribbean Sea. The island of Cura&ccedil;ao was only a
small dot in the sea behind them. Directly below,
they saw a slender, cigar-shaped cruise ship heading
for the port Charlie Keene and Derek had just left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff&rsquo;s been in plenty of tough spots, Derek. I&rsquo;ve
been in some of them with him. I&rsquo;d never have let
him take that chance if I didn&rsquo;t think he could handle
it. Still&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have any peace of mind until we&rsquo;re
all together again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be good, Mr. Keene. It seems I only see
Biff for a few minutes, then we&rsquo;re separated again.
I like Biff. I want to know him better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie smiled. It pleased him that his
nephew and Derek had become friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, Derek. And you&rsquo;re right. Biff&rsquo;s as fine
a fellow as you&rsquo;ll ever know. You two ought to have
a great time, skin diving for pearls. You ever do any
skin diving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some. In the Mediterranean. I went there with my
grandparents last summer. Biff&rsquo;s done a lot of skin
diving, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure has, Derek. In Hawaii and off the coast
of Southern California. His family has a cottage
on a lake out there. The whole family goes in for
the sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little after eight-thirty, the island of Martinique
came into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another ten minutes and we&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; Charlie
said. He put the plane into a long, gentle descent.
They came in low over Fort-de-France, circled the
city, then came back to set down in the harbor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>At about the same time Charles Keene was setting
the seaplane down, Crunch was setting Biff&rsquo;s breakfast
before him. While Crunch had been at the big
house to pick up the food, Biff had inspected his
prison carefully. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to determine
that escape was out of the question. The iron bars on
the windows were three-quarters of an inch thick
and deeply imbedded in the concrete. Biff tested each
bar, just in case there might be a loose one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; Biff thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here until someone
comes for me. Unless&mdash;unless I can outfox Crunch
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Biff and Crunch ate their breakfasts in silence.
When they had finished, Biff tried to draw the giant
out. His first questions were met with grunted replies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff tried again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
all over the world, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen a
man as big and strong as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pleased smile came over the Indian&rsquo;s face. He still
didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In China, I knew a man called Muscles. I thought
he was strong. But you could handle him easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pleased smile on Crunch&rsquo;s simple face grew
broader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your boss Dietz has already gone?&rdquo; Biff
shot the question in while Crunch was still enjoying
the flattery.</p>
<p>Crunch froze. The pleased expression left his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to answer if you don&rsquo;t want to.
I know he&rsquo;s gone. I heard the car leave early this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear car leave, you know boss gone. Why
you ask?&rdquo; Crunch demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just something to talk about, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said
casually. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get mighty tired of one
another just sitting here in silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian didn&rsquo;t reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Crunch, I think I could get to like you.
You don&rsquo;t look like a bad man to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch good man,&rdquo; the Indian said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you work for Dietz?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me. But I know we
could be friends. I&rsquo;m not going to try to get away
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do one time. Make fool out of Crunch. Boss
Dietz very mad at Crunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to believe this, Crunch, but I
never did escape from you. Honestly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you make joke with Crunch. You get away.
Last night. Before sky get dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I, Crunch?&rdquo; Biff asked. &ldquo;Have you
looked around the windows? The bars are still all in
them, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch look good. Bars all there. You get out by
magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff laughed. &ldquo;Well, I must admit, I did use a trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See. Crunch know. You get out by magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I got out by magic once, why couldn&rsquo;t I do it
again? Like right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff stood up. Crunch leaped to his feet and
grabbed Biff by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go, Crunch go with you,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too much of a trick for me,&rdquo; Biff said,
laughing. &ldquo;Even if you do think I&rsquo;m magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch released his grasp. Biff sat down, rubbing
his arm where the giant had grabbed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like Dietz, Crunch? Do you like working
for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch frowned. He looked like a big, bad boy
forced to do something he didn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Biff went on. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe
a man like you would work for a bad man like Dietz
if you didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to,&rdquo; Crunch said. His hand flew to his mouth,
as if he were trying to force back the words he had
just spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said. He was winning
this man over. Biff felt a definite sympathy for
Crunch. &ldquo;Why do you work for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch was silent for a minute. When he finally
spoke, there was a surprising bitterness in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch have brother. Little brother. He do bad
thing one time. Have to leave Cura&ccedil;ao. He go to
Martinique. Lots of Carib Indians still in Martinique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch stopped speaking. This was the longest statement
he had made. It seemed to pain him to talk so
much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Martinique, brother work for boss Dietz. He
tell boss Dietz what he do. He hope to come back to
Cura&ccedil;ao. Boss Dietz say he help.&rdquo; Crunch paused
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He come to Crunch. Say if Crunch don&rsquo;t
work for him, do everything he say, he tell police. If
police catch little brother, him go way to jailhouse
for long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you work for Dietz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch nodded his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch go back to house now. You stay here. No
use magic to get out of jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;I promise not to
use magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff felt so sorry for the giant at that moment, he
wouldn&rsquo;t have walked out on him had Crunch left
the door wide open.</p>
<p>Crunch didn&rsquo;t, however. He made sure the door
was locked.</p>
<p>In Martinique, Charlie Keene and Derek were coming
out of the Fisheries Commissioner&rsquo;s office. They
had the papers. The working permit had been signed,
and it was now tucked in Derek&rsquo;s inside coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard so many questions, Mr. Keene,&rdquo;
Derek said. &ldquo;That man asked the same ones over and
over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was stalling, Derek. He didn&rsquo;t want to give us
that permit,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s uncle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust that clerk. I have a feeling he may be
dealing with Dietz. Just how, I haven&rsquo;t figured out
yet. But I&rsquo;ll bet Dietz promised to cut him in if he
could hold up giving us the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he did give them to us,&rdquo; Derek remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a struggle. Come on, Derek, let&rsquo;s get back to
the plane and hop over to La Trinit&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where my father had his headquarters, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s where I last saw him, and that was the
postmark on the letters and the packaged pearls he
sent us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Charlie and Derek took a battered taxi driven by a
barefoot native back to the airport. The water basin
where Charlie&rsquo;s plane was tied up to a long ramp adjoined
the airport.</p>
<p>They got there just about noon. They saw a
commercial plane come in for a landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the plane from Cura&ccedil;ao, Derek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched the plane taxi in. They had to pass
right by it on the way to the seaplane. The door of
the plane opened as they went by. Passengers began
deplaning. Derek looked back at them. He grabbed
Biff&rsquo;s uncle by the arm. Charles Keene swung around
in time to see Dietz and Specks come down the unloading
stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t let them see us.&rdquo; Keene took Derek
by the arm and hustled him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This calls for a change in plans,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s uncle said.
&ldquo;Something must have gone wrong. I&rsquo;m really worried
about Biff now. I&rsquo;ll fly you over to La Trinit&eacute;,
then get back to Cura&ccedil;ao. You&rsquo;d better lie low. Dietz
will be heading for La Trinit&eacute; as soon as he learns
we&rsquo;ve beat him to the punch again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you come back?&rdquo; Derek asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can. As soon as I can free Biff. Don&rsquo;t
let Dietz get his hands on you while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Derek declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to spend
the time, until you and Biff return, looking for my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Almost Away</span></h2>
<p>Charles Keene was winging his way back to
Cura&ccedil;ao. Derek Zook was in La Trinit&eacute; across the
Island of Martinique from Fort-de-France. Biff Brewster
was still a prisoner in the cellhouse outside Willemstad.
Herman Dietz and Specks Cade were at the
Fisheries Commission Office in Fort-de-France, giving
a cowering clerk a very hard time.</p>
<p>A tall, gaunt man, his body wasted away by a long
siege of fever, lay on a narrow cot in a monastery
high in the Pitons du Carbet.</p>
<p>The time was approaching when all these people
would be drawn closer and closer together, the magnet
attracting them being a small but rich pearl fishery
in the Baie du Tr&eacute;sor.</p>
<p>When Charlie dropped Derek off at La Trinit&eacute;, he
had had one suggestion as to where the Dutch lad
could best start his search for his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The post office, Derek,&rdquo; Charles Keene had said.
&ldquo;That would be your best bet. Your letter and mine
both bore the La Trinit&eacute; postmark. See what you can
find out there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Derek was now following Charles Keene&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tall man, you say. Very fair with light-brown
hair?&rdquo; the postal clerk asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. My father,&rdquo; Derek said. &ldquo;I know he was
here about three months ago, perhaps a little longer
than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postal clerk thought for a moment. &ldquo;There
was such a man as you describe. I recall him. His appearance
was in such contrast to the rest of us here
in Trinit&eacute;. But I have not seen him for months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I haven&rsquo;t heard from him either. I am
desperately anxious for any hint as to where he might
have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zook. That was his name, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Derek replied eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, the name I remember because it is so different
from the names of the people who live here.
Yes, many of us knew about this man. He was searching
the waters of our treasure bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my father, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was rumored that he searched for pearls,&rdquo; the
clerk went on. &ldquo;The people of this village had great
interest in his activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would there be any one person who might have
known him well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was not out searching the ocean floor,
he stayed at a small <i>pension</i> not far from here. You
could inquire there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is called by the name of Pension Sans Souci. You
will have no trouble in finding it. It is on this very
street. When you go out, turn to your right. A
walk of two blocks will bring you there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Merci.</i> Thank you very much,&rdquo; Derek said.</p>
<p>His hopes were high as he walked down the street
under a blazing tropical sun. But these high hopes
were short lived. At the Sans Souci, the boardinghouse
whose English name would be &ldquo;Without Care,&rdquo; Derek
learned little more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry, young man, that I cannot give you
news of your father,&rdquo; the manager of the small boardinghouse
told Derek. &ldquo;We were very fond of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left no word as to where he was going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We didn&rsquo;t even know he had left us. One
morning, quite early, he came to our modest establishment.
I thought he seemed quite distraught. He
was not his usual cheerful self. He had hardly a word
with me. And it was his custom to chat with others
here. He went to his room. To rest, I supposed. I
went to awaken him for the noon meal. His room was
empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is all you can tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as I regret it, that is all I know. There
have been rumors&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What are they?&rdquo; Derek wanted any information
that might be a clue to his father&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was reported, shortly after your father left us,
that such a man of his appearance had been seen in the
foothills of the Carbet Mountains. But these tales were
discounted. It would be highly unlikely that your
father would explore the mountains. His interest was
in the ocean and what might be on the bottom of the
sea. I am sorry, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Derek left the Sans Souci very disheartened. If the
rumors were true, why would his father have gone
into the interior of the island? And if he had gone
there, why had he stayed so long?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; Derek said to himself determinedly.
&ldquo;Every chance I get, I&rsquo;ll go into those
foothills and peaks. I&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In Fort-de-France, Herman Dietz could hardly
contain his anger. Specks had never seen the boss so
furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it could not have been,&rdquo; Dietz said angrily.
He and Specks were in the Fisheries Commission
Office. The clerk they were talking to cringed at
Dietz&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo; Dietz raged. &ldquo;I tell you Derek
Zook <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have signed for those papers. Derek
Zook is in Cura&ccedil;ao. Right this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk could only shake his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember what I promised you?&rdquo; Dietz continued.
&ldquo;I told you you would share in the proceeds
of the pearl fishery. There was little you had to do.
Only hold up those rights until I could act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried, Mr. Dietz. I delayed as long as I could.
Keene and the boy were here over two hours. I expected
you here to lodge a protest. But when you
failed to appear, I had to issue the permit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to lodge a protest now. With the
Commissioner himself. I&rsquo;ll tell him how badly you
botched your job! How you permitted an impostor
to fool you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dietz stormed out of the office, followed by Specks,
and made for the office of the Commissioner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Another day is coming to an end, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff
said to the giant Carib. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m getting hungry.
How about my moving that alarm clock up half an
hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch hungry, too. Here.&rdquo; Crunch handed Biff
the alarm clock. Biff moved the alarm, setting it back
from six-thirty to six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, we&rsquo;ll have dinner half an hour earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the long day, Biff had made great progress
in gaining Crunch&rsquo;s confidence and friendship. He
had drawn the simple-minded giant out about his
brother. The crime the brother had committed was a
petty crime, a small theft. Biff felt almost certain
that the police had long since wiped the charge from
the books. Even if they hadn&rsquo;t, the theft had taken
place so long ago that Biff thought the statute of limitations
would have erased the charge.</p>
<p>Dietz, of course, had blown up the seriousness of
the theft into a major crime. He had put a real fear
into Crunch and his brother.</p>
<p>The brother had paid a high price for his deed.
Forced to hide out on Martinique, he had been separated
from his wife and children for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little brother very much want to come back to
Cura&ccedil;ao. Want to see family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff sympathized. &ldquo;I can imagine
how he feels. Does he write? How do you hear
from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No write letters. Can&rsquo;t write. Friends tell about
him. Friends who come to Cura&ccedil;ao from island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Martinique?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. From Martinique Island many, many
boat days away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Crunch, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I
could help your brother come back to Cura&ccedil;ao. He
might have to go to jail. But only for a short time. I
don&rsquo;t know about that. If he did commit that crime,
he&rsquo;d have to pay for it. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if he
faced the charge? His sentence would be light. At the
end, he would be free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch leaned forward to Biff. Big and powerful
as the man was, he had the feelings of a small child.
Biff could see tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do that, Crunch your friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise, Crunch. But I do know that Dietz
has been using you. Misusing is a better word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff wasn&rsquo;t sure Crunch understood. He couldn&rsquo;t
be sure. But he felt that he was getting to the giant
Indian. At first, it had been Biff&rsquo;s plan to gain Crunch&rsquo;s
confidence, outwit him, and escape. He still wanted to
escape, but by now, he felt a great sympathy for the
simple, friendly man. He really wanted to help him.</p>
<p>The alarm bell went off. Crunch stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No magic. You still be here when Crunch come
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff replied.</p>
<p>Crunch went out, still careful to lock the door behind
him. There could be no doubt that his liking
for Biff was growing, but fear of Dietz still guided
the Indian&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>Crunch had been gone about five minutes. Biff
stretched out on the cot and turned on his left side.
&ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; he said as the pen clipped to his shirt pocket
dug into him. He changed the pen to his hip pocket
and settled, face down, relaxed. Suddenly he sat up
again, took out the pen, and stared at it thoughtfully....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Minutes later, Biff was startled by a call, a call
from a voice that was good news to Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff! Biff! Where are you? Sing out so I can come
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Uncle Charlie! I&rsquo;m here! In this house. It&rsquo;s
the one farthest from the big house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way, Biff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff leaped to the door. He stood there, hands
grasping the bars, straining his eyes to spot his uncle.</p>
<p>He saw him coming at a run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Uncle Charlie!&rdquo; Biff called. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be
back for me!&rdquo; He could see the big grin on Charlie&rsquo;s
face as he drew nearer.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s smile of happiness changed to one of dismay.
His uncle was only a few feet away. From behind a
clump of bushes, Crunch appeared. He leaped out as
Charlie passed. His huge arms wrapped around Keene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Biff cried. It was too late.</p>
<p>Charles Keene, a powerful man himself, was helpless
in the giant Indian&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A &ldquo;Magic&rdquo; Alarm</span></h2>
<p>Biff watched his uncle struggle to break free of the
Indian&rsquo;s crushing grasp. He saw the tendons in his
uncle&rsquo;s neck grow taut and stand out as Charlie Keene
heaved his shoulders with every bit of his strength.</p>
<p>It was as if his uncle were trying to break loose
from iron bands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch! Crunch,&rdquo; Biff shouted. &ldquo;Let him go! Let
him go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian only shook his head.</p>
<p>Biff strained at the iron bars, furious that he was unable
to go to his uncle&rsquo;s aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your friend, Crunch! So is that man. He&rsquo;s my
uncle. Let him go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch ignored Biff. Charlie&rsquo;s face was turning red.
The powerful Crunch was actually trying to crush
his smaller opponent. Biff knew he had to do something
and do it fast. But what?</p>
<p>Biff realized that if he were to keep his uncle from
having some ribs cracked, it would have to be brains
against brawn. Maybe Biff could play on the Indian&rsquo;s
superstition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch!&rdquo; he shouted again. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t let him
go, I&rsquo;ll make more magic&mdash;bad magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the words had no effect on Crunch. But
after a few moments, Biff&rsquo;s threat seemed to sink in.
Crunch released some of his pressure, but still held
Charlie Keene firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t let him go, I&rsquo;ll make the magic that
takes me out of this house,&rdquo; Biff threatened.</p>
<p>Crunch was listening now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll disappear, Crunch. Watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff moved away from the doorway. He went to
the window to the right of the door. He stayed below
the opening so Crunch couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I, Crunch?&rdquo; Biff called out. &ldquo;You
think I&rsquo;m at this window, don&rsquo;t you? You hear my
voice at this window. But I&rsquo;m not here. Only my
voice is. My body is at the other window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff leaped across the small room at his last word
and sprang into view at the window to the left of the
door. As he looked out, Crunch was still watching
the other window.</p>
<p>Biff banged the bars of the window, being careful
not to speak. Crunch swung his head around. The
sight of Biff startled him. Biff ducked down. He
cupped his hands and held them to his mouth. Turning
his head in the direction of the other window, he
called in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my voice is still where you first heard it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff raised his head slowly. The simple trick was
working. Crunch had turned to the other window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my voice and body are back together again,
Crunch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The startled expression on Crunch&rsquo;s face showed
the giant Indian&rsquo;s confusion. He was becoming frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only had a clincher,&rdquo; Biff thought. &ldquo;Something
that would really impress Crunch.&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s eyes
lit on the alarm clock. An idea popped into his head.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="Uncaptioned" width="1200" height="590" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to disappear, Crunch,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ll return. And if I return, you will have to release
that man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Biff ducked down. He grabbed the alarm clock
and raced into the back room, careful to keep out of
sight. Biff was counting on the Indian&rsquo;s actually believing
he had disappeared to get enough time to put
his new idea into effect.</p>
<p>Quickly Biff reset the alarm. He set it to go off in
three minutes. He put the alarm lever at &ldquo;<span class="sc">ON</span>.&rdquo; Then
he went to a side window and tossed the alarm clock
out. He saw it land in the soft sand, and prayed the fall
hadn&rsquo;t damaged the clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Biff hurried back to the front room. He got down
on his hands and knees and crawled to the door. It was
a huge door. The bottom half was of heavy, thick timbers.
The upper half was open with five-inch-thick
iron bars. Slowly Biff raised his head until it was just
above the solid half of the door. From the outside his
head looked as if it were detached from his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said the name softly. Crunch, fright
showing in his eyes, looked from one window to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch,&rdquo; Biff called softly again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m down here
now. My head is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch looked at the door. His eyes widened, showing
white. Crunch was becoming terrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you a minute, Crunch. Just one minute.
Then, if you don&rsquo;t release my uncle, evil spirits will
surround you and this house. They will ring
bells....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, I hope,&rdquo; Biff said to himself. Crunch still
held on to Charles Keene. But his grip was nowhere
near as strong as it had been.</p>
<p>Biff waited. In his anxiety, his palms were sweating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve warned you. Let
him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, the alarm clock went off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;EEEEiiiipe!&rdquo; Crunch yelled. He let go of Charlie,
turned, and fled.</p>
<p>Charlie Keene shook himself. He pressed his ribs
with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bones broken. But wow! Is that guy ever
strong! He could have crushed me, Biff. That was
sure quick thinking on your part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Charlie walked over to the door. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known
how powerful that man is,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I never would
have let you get yourself captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff smiled. &ldquo;Crunch isn&rsquo;t as bad as he seems, Uncle
Charlie. He&rsquo;s really a very gentle man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentle! You&rsquo;ve never been given a Crunch bear
hug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean he&rsquo;s a simple soul. He&rsquo;s superstitious. He
really thinks I can magic myself out of this place.
He thinks that&rsquo;s how Derek got out the first time. He
doesn&rsquo;t know, of course, that it was I, not Derek, he
saw outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And speaking of getting outside, just how are
we going to get you out of this place?&rdquo; Uncle Charlie
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch has the key,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve scared him so badly he&rsquo;ll never come
back. Let me take a look at this lock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie examined the lock carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, Biff. It&rsquo;s too strong to force. I can&rsquo;t
open this lock. You&rsquo;re just going to have to magic
your way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or get Crunch to come back and let me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you can, Biff? I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can try,&rdquo; Biff replied. &ldquo;Crunch and I were getting
to be good friends. He&rsquo;s not a bad guy. Dietz
has a hold on him and forces him to do this dirty
work. I&rsquo;m going to call him.... Crunch!&rdquo; Biff sang
out.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch! Can you hear me? If you can, listen carefully.
I&rsquo;ve sent the evil spirits away. They won&rsquo;t harm
you. They have stopped their noises.&rdquo; The alarm
clock had run down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still locked in, Crunch. I promised you I
wouldn&rsquo;t use my magic to get out. I&rsquo;ve kept my
promise. Come back and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this works, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie said in a low
voice, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;ve really got that giant under your
thumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and his uncle waited. No sign of Crunch. No
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be night soon, Biff. He&rsquo;ll never come back in
the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. I&rsquo;m going to try again. Crunch!
Night is coming on. My magic works better in the
dark. If you don&rsquo;t come back before it&rsquo;s dark, then
I&rsquo;ll have to break my promise and magic my way
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to do it if anything will, Biff,&rdquo; Charlie
said.</p>
<p>They waited. Both looked toward the east. Already
the horizon was beginning to darken. Minutes
passed. It would be totally dark in another minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch come back.&rdquo; The deep voice came from
the shadows.</p>
<p>Charlie Keene swung around. Ten feet away, at
the edge of the sand apron extending from the undergrowth
to the house, stood Crunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me do the talking, Uncle Charlie,&rdquo; Biff said in
a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I will, Biff. You know how to handle
that giant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said gently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>The Indian approached cautiously. His head pivoted
from one direction to the other. Crunch was
looking for the evil spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have kept my promise, Crunch. I have not made
the magic that would take me out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to let this man in here with me. I want
to show you that we are your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch was at the door. His hand pulled out the
large key to the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Charlie, Crunch is going to let you come
in with me. Then he will go back to the house for
food for all of us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Biff,&rdquo; Charlie protested, &ldquo;if I get locked in
there with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be all right, Uncle Charlie. Crunch is our
friend. We are his friends. Please, let me handle this
my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Keene shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Okay, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch turned the key in the lock. He swung the
door open. Charlie Keene entered, and Crunch closed
and locked the door. Without another word, he disappeared
in the darkness on the way to the big house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff, if I didn&rsquo;t know you so well, I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;d
gone a little soft in the head.&rdquo; Charlie Keene shook
his own head. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re both locked in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was lighting a candle. In the glow of its light,
Uncle Charlie could see a big smile spread over his
nephew&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so, Uncle Charlie? Watch this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Biff went to the door. He knelt down, holding the
candle&rsquo;s flame at the keyhole. He placed his thumb
and forefinger carefully at the keyhole opening and
grasped a small wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ought to work. I inserted this piece of wire
in the lock&rsquo;s catch. If it wasn&rsquo;t dislodged when
Crunch just now opened the door, then I should be
able to spring the catch with this wire. Hold your
breath, Uncle Charlie. Here goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff tugged smoothly but firmly on the wire. There
was a sharp &ldquo;click.&rdquo; The catch was sprung. Biff
pushed the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did you dig up a piece of wire?&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie asked. &ldquo;Maybe Crunch is right and you do
have a touch of that old black magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff chuckled. &ldquo;Not black, Unc, blue magic.&rdquo; Biff
held out the separate parts of a blue plastic ballpoint
pen. &ldquo;I remembered I had this in my pocket. I
removed the steel spring from it, straightened it the
best I could, and used it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; Charlie Keene said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, Uncle Charlie? You taught
me that trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Keene chuckled. &ldquo;I take it all back, Biff.
There&rsquo;s nothing soft about that head of yours. Now,
let&rsquo;s get out of here! But fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Uncle Charlie? We can get out any time
we want to. Why don&rsquo;t we both spend the night here?
I&rsquo;d like to gain Crunch&rsquo;s confidence completely. He
could be a big help to us on Martinique. It&rsquo;s good to
have a friend in the enemy&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Biff. I think you&rsquo;ve really got something going.
We couldn&rsquo;t get back to Martinique tonight, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Biff opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; his uncle called softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back in a minute.&rdquo; Biff was back in less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to get this,&rdquo; he said with a grin. He held up
the alarm clock. &ldquo;Heap big magic, Uncle Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff left the door open. He and his uncle sat down
on the cot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Crunch comes back and sees the door open,&rdquo;
Biff laughed, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll really think I can out-magic a voodoo
medicine man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Reunited</span></h2>
<p>Biff and his uncle heard Crunch approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see this,&rdquo; Charlie said. He walked over
to the window. Biff was right beside him. Crunch
stood in the sand, staring at the open door. It took
several moments for the Indian to get over his amazement.
He put down the food he was carrying and
moved about in a shuffle, trying to make up his mind
what he should do next.</p>
<p>The giant turned suddenly and started off at a lope,
intending to search the grounds for Biff and his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still here, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff called out. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch stopped. He came back to the cellhouse
slowly. Standing in the doorway, his jaw sagged open.
Disbelief showed in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No go away? No escape?&rdquo; He was completely
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Crunch. I told you we wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you get door open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff only smiled in reply, looking very wise and
mysterious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Magic! You make more magic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Biff still didn&rsquo;t say anything, Crunch went
back outside and got the food. When he came in, he
placed the food on the table, then carefully locked
the door. After he had done so, he looked at the key,
and a foolish expression came over his face, as if he
were asking himself, &ldquo;Why do I lock the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch still wore a puzzled look on his face as he
sat quietly and watched Biff and Uncle Charlie eat the
meal he had prepared for them. It was a fish dish with
a delicious but very hot sauce. The sauce burned the
eaters&rsquo; mouths, making the cool, smooth avocado salad
that went with it highly welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was mighty good, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure was,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie chimed in. He took a sip
of lime drink and spoke to Biff. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better turn in
early. We&rsquo;ll want to get an early start for Martinique.
Going to take Crunch with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Crunch?&rdquo; Biff asked. &ldquo;Would you
like to go to Martinique? You could see your brother.
Maybe my uncle and I could help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch have to stay here. Wait for boss Dietz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dietz is in Martinique, Crunch. He might
need you over there,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>It was going to take some time for Crunch to figure
this one out. He was still afraid of Dietz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over, Crunch, and tell us in the morning,&rdquo;
Biff said.</p>
<p>When dawn broke, and Uncle Charlie shook his
sleep-drugged nephew into wakefulness, both knew
that they had won Crunch completely over. He had
already gone to the main house for food. And he had
left the door wide open!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Made up your mind yet, Crunch?&rdquo; Biff asked the
Carib Indian after they had finished breakfast. &ldquo;You
coming with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch was silent, still torn between his fear of
Dietz and his admiration for Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going now,&rdquo; Biff told him.</p>
<p>Biff and his uncle went to the door. The Indian
made no move to prevent their leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff called.</p>
<p>Crunch stood in the doorway and watched them
leave. At the arched gateway, Biff and his uncle
climbed into the car. Charlie started it up. They were
just beginning to roll when they heard a shout. Looking
back, Biff saw Crunch coming on the run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait! Crunch come with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A completely new life was opening up for Crunch.
He had never been off the island of Cura&ccedil;ao. He had
never been in an aircraft. For the first half of the
flight to Martinique, he sat rigidly in his seat, hands
grasping the seat arms as if he were holding the plane
in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop at Fort-de-France first, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie said. &ldquo;Got to pick up some diving equipment
and other supplies. Then we&rsquo;ll hop on over to
La Trinit&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying low over the waters of the Caribbean, as
his uncle came in for a landing in the harbor, Biff
spotted a large net bobbing in a sweeping arc between
two native boats. The fishermen doffed their broad
straw hats and waved at the plane. Directly over the
seine, Biff could see thousands of fish leaping, swirling,
their silver sides glittering in the sunlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Walking through the teeming streets of the city
was an experience in itself. Fort-de-France with its
66,000 residents is crowded between two rivers gallantly
named Rivi&egrave;re Madame and Rivi&egrave;re Monsieur.
To Biff, it seemed as if every resident of the town
swarmed in the narrow street down which the three
walked that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; Biff said in amazement.</p>
<p>A small native woman walked briskly among the
crowd. A sixty-pound basket of fruit and vegetables
was balanced on her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff, these people are small, but they&rsquo;re powerful.
And they have a magnificent sense of balance,&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie said.</p>
<p>In the basket which the woman wore like a headpiece
were bright red tomatoes, a green pebble-skinned
breadfruit, and some fat pineapples. Under
one arm she carried a full stalk of bananas.</p>
<p>The capital of Martinique was a blaze of color,
from the women&rsquo;s costumes to the buildings and the
flowers growing riotously in every garden and patio.
Beautiful bougainvillea, brilliantly colored from rich,
deep purple and red to pale lavender and violet, spilled
over balconies like cascading waterfalls.</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie led Biff and Crunch to a small hardware
store. There was hardly an inch of open space in
the store. A heavy bathtub hung over the entrance.
Garden hose, bicycles, pots, pans, fishing and skin-diving
equipment crowded shelves and hung from
rafters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can anyone find anything in here?&rdquo; Biff
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;A mystery to me, too, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie
laughed. &ldquo;But the clerks can put their hands on any
item you ask for in a second. They&rsquo;re really out to
serve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was given an example of this as his uncle
made his purchases. In no time at all, Biff and Crunch
were laden with marking buoys, two Scubas&mdash;self-contained,
underwater-breathing apparatus&mdash;and
Uncle Charlie brought up the rear with a gay red-and-white
nylon tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all we need here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the
rest of the stuff we need&mdash;pots and pans and so on&mdash;in
Trinit&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making their way back to the aircraft, Biff envied
the natives their ability to carry tremendous loads
with no apparent effort.</p>
<p>The hop across the island to La Trinit&eacute; was a short
one. The plane was secured to a mooring and gear
unloaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Crunch, what are you going to do?&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find my little brother first,&rdquo; Crunch replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Dietz?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe find him, too. Where Crunch find you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make our headquarters here just
down the street. At the Sans Souci. We&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo;
Charlie Keene said, &ldquo;and if you want to find us, or get
in touch, ask there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Derek?&rdquo; Biff asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to locate
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Biff. In a town this size everybody
knows everything that&rsquo;s going on. I&rsquo;ll bet you right
now the grapevine has spread word of our arrival.
If Derek is around, he&rsquo;ll be looking us up within an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Charles Keene was right. He and Biff checked
into the Sans Souci. Crunch went off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little more shopping, Biff, and we&rsquo;re ready to
take off as soon as Derek locates us, or vice versa,&rdquo;
Biff&rsquo;s uncle said.</p>
<p>Derek caught up with Biff and Uncle Charlie in
midafternoon. The Dutch boy was delighted to rejoin
his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is really fine!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;So good, Biff,
to be back with you and your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes double for me, Derek. Any news of
your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve heard some rumors
about him, but so far, I&rsquo;ve learned nothing definite
as to where he might be. The island grapevine of news
seems to break down just as I think I have a real clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad, Derek,&rdquo; Charlie said. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t give up
hope. We&rsquo;re all together now. Biff and I want to help
you search for your father. It&rsquo;s important to me to find
him, too. After all, I&rsquo;m working for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you working for me now, too?&rdquo; Derek asked
with a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Derek,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie agreed. &ldquo;When
your father&rsquo;s not here, you&rsquo;re the boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work well together. How about it, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff grinned. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t find a better combination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think we have to worry too much
about Dietz now,&rdquo; Charles Keene added.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Uncle Charlie was wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">All Set To Dive</span></h2>
<p>It was nearly five o&rsquo;clock when Biff, Derek, and
Charlie Keene reached the dock in the harbor of the
Baie du Tr&eacute;sor. They rode a truck five miles out of
La Trinit&eacute;. The truck was piled high with gear necessary
to their search.</p>
<p>A thirty-foot cabin cruiser was waiting for them.
Keene had chartered it as his first step after arriving in
La Trinit&eacute;. Slung on davits on the cruiser&rsquo;s stern was a
fourteen-foot dory with an outboard motor. This
was the boat from which they would do the pearl
diving.</p>
<p>With all gear stowed, Uncle Charlie started the
cruiser&rsquo;s engine and backed away. On the dock,
natives waved, calling, &ldquo;<i>Bonne chance! Bonne chance!</i>
Good luck! Good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the wheel, Biff,&rdquo; his uncle ordered. &ldquo;Head
straight out while I confer with the owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner?&rdquo; Biff and Derek glanced around the
cruiser, then looked curiously at Uncle Charlie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you, Derek.&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s uncle grinned. &ldquo;Since
you&rsquo;re the boss, you&rsquo;re the owner. I&rsquo;m the skipper, and
Biff is the crew. And I&rsquo;m sure you want a tightly run
ship, so look sharp there, Brewster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, skipper,&rdquo; Biff said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Derek, where do we head?&rdquo; Uncle Charlie
asked. &ldquo;Did your father give you any idea where this
pearl fishery is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a vague one, Captain.&rdquo; Derek had entered
the spirit of the game. &ldquo;I know that after leaving Treasure
Bay Harbor, we head due south&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her around, mate,&rdquo; Keene called to Biff. &ldquo;Set
your compass reading for a southerly run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had left the harbor, and Biff spun the wheel.
The cruiser&rsquo;s bow came around, and Biff held the
boat on a due south course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wrote me the spot was about five miles off the
main coast of Martinique,&rdquo; Derek said, &ldquo;almost directly
west of the town of Le Fran&ccedil;ois.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the town.&rdquo; Keene nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small
fishing village. Ten miles down the coast. Put her at
full speed, mate. We&rsquo;ve got to make a landing before
nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a group of small islands off Le Fran&ccedil;ois,&rdquo;
Derek continued. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to locate the right island.
The fishery is a mile off one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Keene wiped the sweat off his forehead.
&ldquo;Whew! Not much to go on. There must be a dozen
or more islands in that group. Some of them aren&rsquo;t
more than a few acres in area. We&rsquo;ll make camp on
one of the larger ones. Did your father give you any
indication of water depth at the fishery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About forty feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will help. We won&rsquo;t do any diving in water
over, say, fifty feet. But, Derek, there&rsquo;s lots and lots
of water around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there was. The coast line and pitons of Martinique
were plainly visible, a lush green of wild
growth, with fern trees rising as high as maples. West
were the endless waters of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need all the &lsquo;<i>bonne chance</i>&rsquo; we can get,&rdquo;
Biff&rsquo;s uncle commented.</p>
<p>It took about an hour to make the run from Treasure
Bay to the islands off Le Fran&ccedil;ois. Biff was still at
the wheel. His uncle took out a pair of binoculars
and swept his gaze over the island group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there, Biff. That larger one, right between
those two smaller ones. Cut your speed. We don&rsquo;t
know how these waters shoal. Derek, go forward.
Watch for bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cruiser approached the shore slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of water,&rdquo; Derek sang out. Then, &ldquo;Sand.
I see sand bottom,&rdquo; he called a little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ease her in, Biff. That small cove. See if you can
take her in there. Give us some protection if a <i>chabasco</i>
hits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cruiser inched forward. The sound of the
boat&rsquo;s keel grating on the sand bottom came to
their ears. Biff cut the engine. The cruiser ground to
a stop five feet from shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect, Biff. We&rsquo;ll get a little damp making the
next five feet, but I kind of feel like a swim. How
about it?&rdquo; Uncle Charlie suggested.</p>
<p>Biff and Derek stripped off their shirts. Shoes and
socks followed. The boys dived over the side. Charlie
Keene was right behind them. All three frolicked in
the warm waters of the Caribbean for a while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;All out,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie ordered presently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got work to do. Night&rsquo;s coming on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cruiser was secured. The dory was lowered
and pulled up on the beach. Biff&rsquo;s uncle remained in
the cruiser. Derek took a position waist deep in the
water halfway between the boat&rsquo;s bow and the shore.
Charlie passed gear to Derek. Derek handed it on to
Biff on shore. The unloading went smoothly and
quickly.</p>
<p>Next came the tent. It was set up. Cots were unfolded.
A small table and three captain&rsquo;s chairs were
put into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scoop out a wide, shallow hole and line it with
shells.&rdquo; That was Uncle Charlie&rsquo;s next order. He
kept the boys hopping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put our stove in the shell-lined hole.&rdquo; Charlie
ripped open a carton containing a small two-burner
propane stove and set it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;String up the lanterns, Biff. It&rsquo;ll be dark soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The job of setting up camp was completed just as
the swift-falling night blanketed the tiny island with
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything look shipshape to you, skipper?&rdquo; Biff
asked his uncle.</p>
<p>Charlie Keene looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t log anything against either of you so far.
Good job. Now let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Derek peeled some potatoes; Uncle Charlie
took a small axe and broke open a canned ham, disdaining
to use the key attached to the can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ham and fried potatoes. How does that sound?&rdquo;
Uncle Charlie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could eat anything,&rdquo; Biff replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well open up a can of stewed tomatoes,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The food, although roughly prepared, seemed delicious
to all three. Uncle Charlie was a good cook.
The potatoes were crisp and brown. The tomatoes,
well, they were just stewed tomatoes. The Danish
ham had a delicate flavor unlike any Biff had eaten
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather like the hams we have in Holland,&rdquo;
Derek said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only two problems in connection with running
this camp,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie commented. &ldquo;Air and
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air? I&rsquo;ve never breathed such pure air,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much more water do you want than the
Caribbean Sea?&rdquo; Derek chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever tried drinking it?&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s uncle chuckled.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Fresh water, my lad, is what we need. And
there are no springs or wells on these islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we couldn&rsquo;t find any fresher air,&rdquo; Biff said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to admit that, Uncle Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Biff, sure. But what we want is compressed
air. For the Scubas. Those air tanks only
carry enough for an hour&rsquo;s diving. I have one extra
tank. We have enough compressed air for about
two hours&rsquo; diving daily. I mean two hours for each
of you. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any compressed air in
Le Fran&ccedil;ois. I know there is in Trinit&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not too far,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
go in to Trinit&eacute; every day. Air and water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And fresh food, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie added.</p>
<p>Derek had been silent during this discussion. Now
he spoke:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keene, I have a plan I want to suggest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, Derek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we have to go in to Trinit&eacute; every day, I
think we ought to do our diving in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay by me, Derek. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, around noon, we could go into Trinit&eacute;. You
and Biff could see about supplies. I&rsquo;d like to spend my
afternoons searching for my father. I&rsquo;m more anxious
to find him than to locate the pearl fishery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all are, Derek. And I think your plan&rsquo;s a good
one. We could even spend the night at the Sans Souci
if we got any leads that would take more than one
afternoon to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. Martinique&rsquo;s not too big an
island, but there are many wild, unsettled places on it.
I have a feeling that if my father is still alive, he&rsquo;s up in
the hills somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Derek, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe your
father&rsquo;s not alive,&rdquo; Biff said softly.</p>
<p>Derek didn&rsquo;t answer at once. When he did, his voice
trembled slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I learned that I didn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;
He paused. &ldquo;There was a storm, a <i>chabasco</i>, about
the time my father disappeared. I learned that, three
days after the <i>chabasco</i>, parts of his boat were washed
ashore south of here. Near Le Vauclin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Biff nor his uncle replied. They knew
what Derek&rsquo;s fear was. His father might have lost his
life in the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows, though,&rdquo; Derek went on hopefully,
&ldquo;or seems to remember, whether the <i>chabasco</i>
struck before or after my father was last seen in
Trinit&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean when he mailed us our letters?&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was Derek&rsquo;s one-word reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can check that, Derek. The postmark will
show the date. And the day of the <i>chabasco</i> will have
been recorded somewhere in Trinit&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; Derek said. He sounded
much more cheerful. Charles Keene had restored his
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big day ahead of us, boys,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s uncle said now.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it was about time to hit the sack. You with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Derek were. It seemed impossible to Biff
that only that morning, he had been in Cura&ccedil;ao. It
also seemed to Biff that he had just heard his uncle
say, &ldquo;Hit the sack,&rdquo; when his uncle&rsquo;s voice came to
him again. This time it was, &ldquo;Hit the deck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morning had come. In an hour, Biff would be at the
bottom of the ocean, searching for pearls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Pearl Diving</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go out, we&rsquo;re going to have a dry run
with the Scubas,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s uncle announced.</p>
<p>Biff, Derek, and Uncle Charlie were on the beach
where the cruiser was anchored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how much skin diving you&rsquo;ve done,
Derek&mdash;you said some&mdash;but Biff can tell you that all
diving equipment must be carefully and thoroughly
checked out before you go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek paid sharp attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don your Scubas,&rdquo; Charlie ordered.</p>
<p>The boys quickly slipped on face masks, helmets,
water lungs, snorkels. Charlie helped them strap their
compressed-air tanks on their backs.</p>
<p>Next the boys put on their weight belts. Into
a rubber scabbard on each belt went a wickedly
sharp knife. There were sharks in these waters. A
depth gauge and watch were strapped on each boy&rsquo;s
left wrist.</p>
<p>Charlie inspected each item of diving equipment
carefully. He tugged at straps, examined each piece
of gear separately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jettison belts!&rdquo; he called out suddenly.</p>
<p>With a flip of his hand, Biff hit the catch on his
weight belt. It dropped to the sand. Derek was a few
seconds longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seconds can count, Derek, if you get into trouble.
Try it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek slipped his weight belt back on. Charlie
shouted the order. Derek hit the catch, and his belt
dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, Derek. Remember, that belt is what
holds you down. If you have to come up fast,
you&rsquo;ve got to get rid of that belt fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t try to come up too fast, Derek,&rdquo; Biff
said. &ldquo;Especially if you&rsquo;re down deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff&rsquo;s right. A good rule to follow is not to rise
to the surface any faster than the escaping air bubbles.
Your body has to adjust to the variations in water
pressure. All right, let&rsquo;s go out and try it in the
water now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed in the dory. Uncle Charlie started
the outboard, and they moved offshore about fifty
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound for depth, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff dropped a sounding line overboard. He pulled
it up, examined the leads marking off every three feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty feet, Uncle Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Now you know how to clear your masks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys nodded their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff began promptly: &ldquo;If water seeps into your
mask, clouding the glass and obscuring your vision,
you roll over on your back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it from there, Derek,&rdquo; Charlie cut in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then you blow air out through your nose.
The air pressure building up in the mask will force the
water out around the edges of the mask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. You both know the most important safety
feature of skin diving. Okay, over you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys slipped their swim fins, or flippers, on
their feet and lowered themselves overboard. They
sank slowly to the bottom.</p>
<p>At this point, the bottom was smooth, clean white
sand. Biff and Derek moved around, using their legs
and feet only for propulsion. Biff came up to Derek,
circled his thumb and forefinger together, indicating
that everything was going smoothly. Derek replied
with the &ldquo;V for Victory&rdquo; sign. Then they rose to
the surface.</p>
<p>When they broke water, Charlie Keene was waiting
with another order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down again, and as soon as you touch bottom,
jettison your belts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down they went again. Charles Keene was taking
no chances on the boys&rsquo; safety and ability to skin dive.</p>
<p>Up popped the boys, their wet heads appearing
above the water first and looking like strange creatures
from the deep. Biff flipped back his face mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Biff. But you&rsquo;ve got to go back down
and retrieve the weight belts. Here&rsquo;s a spare. You&rsquo;d
find it tough to get down thirty feet without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek climbed aboard the dory while Biff submerged
to pick up the belts. He had to make two
trips. The weight of three belts would have held him
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well start our search off this island
first. Good as any.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1096" />
<p class="caption"><i>At this point, the bottom was smooth, clean white sand</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>The dory sped out to a point Uncle Charlie estimated
to be about a mile away. The anchor was
tossed overboard. The sounding line showed the water
depth at just over forty-five feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to take this spear along with you,
Biff.&rdquo; Uncle Charlie handed his nephew a wicked, lethal-looking
weapon. Its tip was needle sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt you&rsquo;ll run into any bad fish here. But you
might. And don&rsquo;t, <i>do not</i> use it except in case of extreme
danger. If you spear an attacking fish&mdash;shark,
barracuda or octopus&mdash;remember any blood will attract
other sharks, and then you&rsquo;ll be in real trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff took the spear and examined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each of you take one of these wire baskets.
They&rsquo;re to load the oysters in&mdash;if you find any.
I&rsquo;m the puller-up. I&rsquo;ve a line on each basket. Now get
these signals. I want both of you to give me one
sharp tug every ten minutes. That will tell me you&rsquo;re
okay. Give two sharp tugs when your basket is filled.
I&rsquo;ll pull the basket up, unload it, and lower it again.
Now, in case of emergency, a series of sharp tugs will
alert me, and I&rsquo;ll be right down. Got it? Okay.
Over you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bottom was different this time. Instead of clean,
white sand, the bottom was covered with a layer of
mud mixed with sand. Biff felt around carefully.
Both boys were wearing thick rubber gloves to protect
their hands against the sharp, jagged oyster
shells.</p>
<p>As Biff was feeling around in the mud, Derek swam
over to him. He held a large oyster in front of Biff&rsquo;s
mask. Then he plopped it in his basket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s hand touched a large shell. He dug it out and
discarded it. It was a clam. He ran into a nest of oysters.
He quickly filled his basket and gave the signal
to haul up. Minutes later, the basket came down,
swaying in the water at the bottom of the line.</p>
<p>The boys worked slowly, carefully, feeling their
way. Every so often, a large fish would swim up to
them, coming right to the face masks as if to ask,
&ldquo;What are <i>you</i> doing down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff kept a sharp check on his watch. He knew his
air tank had sufficient air to remain submerged for
one hour. It also had a five-minute emergency supply
in addition. Biff had no intention of waiting until he
had to use the extra air. After being down fifty-five
minutes, he signaled Derek. With his forefinger, he
pointed upward. Derek got the idea. The boys began
their slow ascent.</p>
<p>Rising, looking up toward the surface, they could
see the dory outlined above, a fat, cigar-shaped blob.</p>
<p>Breaking water as they surfaced, each boy grabbed
the dory&rsquo;s gunwale. They were both tired. Neither
had realized how the water pressure at forty-five feet
had sapped their strength. They had been down
nearly an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what a tough job diving is until
you&rsquo;ve been down for a good spell,&rdquo; Charlie said. He
leaned over the side and helped the boys into the
boat.</p>
<p>They took off their diving equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had enough for today, boys?&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s uncle inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We&rsquo;ll go down again. After we rest,&rdquo;
Biff replied. &ldquo;All right with you, Derek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek nodded his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, I don&rsquo;t see much point in going back
down,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got ten baskets
of oysters. We might as well shuck them and see if we
find any pearls. If we don&rsquo;t, then we&rsquo;ll say good-by to
this spot and try another tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I like that idea,&rdquo; Biff said and stretched out
on the narrow seat that ran around the side of the
dory.</p>
<p>His uncle upped anchor, and they headed back to
their island camp.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t go into Trinit&eacute; that day, since they
still had the reserve tank of compressed air and
enough food for supper. The afternoon was spent at
the tedious job of opening oysters. It was slow going.
None of the three had the skill of a professional
oyster opener.</p>
<p>The job was totally unrewarding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one pearl.&rdquo; Biff sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even a single tiny one,&rdquo; Derek said sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be downhearted, boys,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie
said, trying to cheer them up. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t expect to hit
it the first day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we&rsquo;ve got enough oysters to make a
stew. If we had some milk,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid not, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Where are we going to get milk? A seacow,
maybe? Wish we&rsquo;d kept some of them. We could
have had an oyster roast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong again, Biff,&rdquo; Charlie said. &ldquo;Pearl oysters
aren&rsquo;t edible. These would make you so sick, you
wouldn&rsquo;t be any good for ten days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a waste!&rdquo; Biff said, and stretched out on
the sand. Every muscle, every bone in his body ached.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>All three went to bed that night right after supper.</p>
<p>Biff, having slept heavily, awoke just as dawn broke.
He thought he had been awakened by the sound of a
boat&rsquo;s motor. He listened intently. No sound. Biff
turned over on his narrow cot, determined to get
back to sleep. He was just drifting off when he
heard a sound outside the tent, just beyond where his
cot touched the inside of the tent wall.</p>
<p>He waited tensely. The sound was only a faint
rustle. He saw the side of the tent stretch as if something
was crawling underneath it. Biff raised himself
on one elbow, ready to sound the alarm.</p>
<p>As he watched, in the faint dawn light, a thick,
snake-shaped object slithered up between his cot and
the tent&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Enemy Invasion</span></h2>
<p>Biff moved quickly, noiselessly out of his cot. In
the increasing daylight, he could see that the strange
object slithering over his bed was a huge arm. He
went over to his uncle, shook him gently, and when
Charlie Keene roused, Biff cautioned silence, pressing
a finger to his lips. Biff pointed to his cot.</p>
<p>Charlie Keene saw the arm and was up in a flash.
From under his pillow he took a gun. This action
startled Biff even more than the mysterious arm. He
had no idea that his uncle thought they were in such
danger that there was reason for keeping a gun close
at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slip
outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff kept his eyes on the arm. He saw the arm slide
over the cot, saw the hand feel it. The hand withdrew
quickly, the arm slipped back outside the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it!&rdquo; Biff heard his uncle command. This
stern order was followed by an amazed &ldquo;Why, what
the&mdash;what are you doing here! Biff! Come running!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Biff leaped out of the tent. In the morning light, he
saw his uncle holding a gun on the giant Carib
Indian, Crunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch!&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s astonishment turned to delight at
seeing his simple, friendly enemy again. &ldquo;What in the
world? Why did you sneak up on us like this!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Crunch stepped over to Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not know who might be in tent. Want to find my
friend, you. Have story of big trouble for you and
your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Crunch? Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is boss Dietz. See Crunch in Trinit&eacute;. Make
Crunch come back and work for him. Last night,
Dietz and Specks make camp on next island.&rdquo; Crunch
pointed in the direction of an island about half a mile
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They leave Crunch to guard camp. But Crunch
hear them talk. Tonight, when you all asleep, they
come to this island. They going to break up your
boats. Crunch wait until they far away, then come
over here to give warning. Dietz bad man, very&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch left his sentence hanging in air. He stared
in disbelief at the front of the tent.</p>
<p>He was looking at Derek. His eyes swung from
Derek to Biff, then back to Derek and back again
from one boy to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is more magic!&rdquo; Crunch howled, terror in his
voice. He turned to run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Crunch. Stop.&rdquo; Biff ran over to the Indian
and took him by the arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more magic. There
are really two of us. Me&mdash;I&rsquo;m Biff. That&rsquo;s my name.
He&rsquo;s my friend Derek. Come here, Derek.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Derek joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touch him, Crunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch&rsquo;s hand went out carefully. He touched
Derek, then drew his hand back quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Crunch, he&rsquo;s not a ghost, not a spirit.
He&rsquo;s a real person. Just like I am. The only thing,
we look very much alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch could only shake his head. If his faith in
Biff had not been so great, he would have turned and
fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Crunch. You believe me? You know
you&rsquo;re not just seeing things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crunch nodded his head slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Crunch. We want to thank you for giving
us this warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No want you to get hurt. Now Crunch go before
boss comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Derek walked to the edge of the water with
Crunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix some chow,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie called.</p>
<p>The boys watched Crunch climb into a small dory
and row off. He was facing them as he pulled away,
and he was still staring from one boy to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Biff asked when he and
Derek rejoined Charlie Keene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We carry on as if we knew nothing. We&rsquo;ll explore
another place this morning. We&rsquo;ll go to Trinit&eacute; this
afternoon and replenish our air and food supplies.
Tonight, we&rsquo;ll be ready to give Dietz an unexpected
reception.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The pearl diving that morning was no more productive
than it had been the previous day. Noon
found the three in the cabin cruiser, heading for
Trinit&eacute;. In town, Derek left Biff and his uncle. He
was off on his quest for his father.</p>
<p>The three met again at the prearranged hour of six
o&rsquo;clock and embarked for the return trip to their
island camp.</p>
<p>Tension mounted as the evening hours on the island
dragged slowly by. At 11 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> Charlie Keene arose
from his cot. He had ordered Biff and Derek to try
and rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys followed Uncle Charlie down to the
cabin cruiser and the dory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You both know what you&rsquo;re to do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Keene,&rdquo; Derek replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set, Uncle Charlie,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch may or may not be with them. I imagine
he will be. But I&rsquo;m sure we don&rsquo;t have to worry about
him now. Okay, Derek, into the cruiser. Biff, you and
I will hide behind the dory. Derek, you know when
to start and what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Take your positions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek waded out and climbed aboard the cruiser.
Biff and his uncle dug into the sand on the beach side
of the dory.</p>
<p>Their wait began. It seemed endless. Biff kept
glancing at the illuminated dial of his watch. Twelve
o&rsquo;clock. Twelve-thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think maybe they found out that Crunch warned
us?&rdquo; Biff asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Biff. How would they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Just after one o&rsquo;clock, Biff and his uncle came alert.
From a distance over the water, they heard the sound
of a boat engine. It grew louder as the boat drew
nearer. Then the sound stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>Biff was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engine trouble, or have they given up the idea?&rdquo;
he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; his uncle whispered back.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, a new sound came to their
ears: the sound of oars rasping against oarlocks, the
soft splash of oar blades dipping in and out of the
water.</p>
<p>Biff knew now why the engine had been cut&mdash;so
Dietz could approach without awakening his prey.</p>
<p>The sound of a boat grating gently on sand was
heard next. Dietz and Company had made their landing.
Biff and his uncle could hear two men conversing
in low voices. The voices came nearer. The enemy
was standing directly across from where Biff and his
uncle lay hidden behind the dory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk up toward the tent, Crunch.&rdquo; It was Dietz&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;Keep them from coming down here if they
wake up. Okay, Specks, start drilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the plot! Drill holes in the dory. Make it
unfloatable. What devilment had they planned for
the cruiser? These thoughts flashed through Biff&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>Just as Specks lifted one leg over the gunwale,
Charlie Keene, still hidden, let go with his automatic.
Eight shots in rapid succession shattered the night
silence.</p>
<p>From the cabin cruiser came blast after blast from
the boat&rsquo;s foghorn. <i>Hurrammppp!</i> ... <i>Hurrammppp!</i>
... <i>Hurrammppp!</i></p>
<p>Specks leaped out of the dory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re laying for us,&rdquo; Dietz shouted. &ldquo;Run for
the boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie had slipped in another cartridge clip,
and this time his eight rapid-fire shots were aimed just
over the heads of the fleeing Dietz and Specks. Derek
kept working the foghorn. The noise tore at the
night.</p>
<p>Dietz slipped and fell into the water as he jumped
for his boat. Specks was frantically shoving it off
the beach. Dietz scrambled in. Bullets from the automatic&rsquo;s
third clip were stinging the water around
Dietz&rsquo;s boat like angry wasps.</p>
<p>The frightened pair finally got their engine started,
backed off at full throttle, swung around and headed
out to sea.</p>
<p>The foghorn continued its angry growling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Derek,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie called. &ldquo;Lay off.
They&rsquo;re long gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek joined Biff and his uncle, and they watched
the light of the fast-disappearing boat. Then, the tension
relieved, the three sank down on the sand and
howled with laughter.</p>
<p>When Biff was finally able to control his laughing
spell, he got up with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What happened to him?
I didn&rsquo;t see him get in the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably halfway across the Atlantic by
now,&rdquo; Charlie answered. &ldquo;Swimming his lungs out
to get away from the evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A search of the small island was started. Crunch
was found on the far side, cowering behind a small
sand dune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Once the giant Indian had been calmed down&mdash;and
Biff had to work hard on him to convince him the evil
spirits had fled&mdash;Crunch fell to his knees and with
outstretched arms, said to Biff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please. Crunch stay with you now, work for you?
Do anything you say. Crunch afraid to go back to
boss Dietz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Crunch. Glad to have you join
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four walked back to the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going to sleep, Crunch,&rdquo;
Biff said doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch not sleep&mdash;stand guard outside tent,&rdquo; the
Indian replied.</p>
<p>Biff turned to his uncle. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Dietz trying to
accomplish now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harassment, Biff. Stalling. Working out a plan.
First of all, he wants to be around when we locate
the exact spot of the pearl fishery. Then&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what, Mr. Keene?&rdquo; Derek asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to worry about, Derek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re holding something back, Mr. Keene. I want
to know the truth. I want to know what I&rsquo;m in for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Keene spoke in a quiet voice. But his words
were chilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as he knows, your father is gone, Derek&mdash;if
Dietz can get rid of <i>you</i>, then the claim becomes
open again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Gay Deception</span></h2>
<p>Although the attack by Dietz and Company had
had a comic ending, Biff, his uncle, and Derek realized
that the next such attack might have more serious
consequences.</p>
<p>The three had settled down on the soft white sand.
No one spoke, their minds whirling with thoughts
of Dietz. The giant Indian, Crunch, was a few feet
removed, squatting on his huge haunches and chewing
on a piece of salt grass.</p>
<p>Charlie Keene looked at his nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing some heavy thinking, Biff?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to, Uncle Charlie. Look ...&rdquo; he paused,
then went on. &ldquo;I have a feeling that since Dietz failed
on this try, he&rsquo;ll grow even more desperate. I mean,
the next time he tries, he probably won&rsquo;t be so
easy to scare off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was silent again. He wanted to be clear in
his own mind before he advanced the proposal he had
outlined to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Derek, I don&rsquo;t want you to be offended by what
I&rsquo;m about to say. It&rsquo;s just that I want to get my thinking
clear. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing you could say, Biff, could make me feel
angry with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Derek.&rdquo; The two boys looked at one another
in the starlit night. The bond of friendship between
them had grown stronger with each passing
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this, Derek. Finding the pearl fishery is of
secondary importance to you. Finding your father
comes first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Keene waited. He knew his nephew was
cooking up a plan. He also knew that most of Biff&rsquo;s
plans had merit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Biff continued. &ldquo;As I see it, we&rsquo;re
faced with two big problems. First, if we abandon
our search for the pearl fishery, to devote all our
time to looking for your father, then we give Dietz
a wide-open field to try to find the fishery. That&rsquo;s
not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t, Biff. But I must find my father,&rdquo;
Derek replied earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, Biff,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a
problem.&rdquo; Charles Keene offered no suggestions. He
was anxious to see how his nephew would attack the
problem, what solution he might come up with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Charlie, a few moments ago you used the
word &lsquo;harassment.&rsquo; You said that would be the chief
tactic used by Dietz to delay our locating the pearl
fishery,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll double his efforts if I&rsquo;m any judge. What&rsquo;s
on your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we can pull it off&mdash;&rdquo; Biff was thinking out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull what off, Biff?&rdquo; Derek asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan. I want to know what you and
Uncle Charlie think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, Biff,&rdquo; his uncle invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this. Suppose tomorrow, we pretend to find
the fishery. We&rsquo;ll fire off guns. Blast off on the boat
horn. Dance around the beach like mad. In full sight
of Dietz, of course. Make him think we&rsquo;ve located
the site. Only, of course, we&rsquo;ll do all this where we
know there are no pearls. We&rsquo;ll put on our act at
one of the first places we tackled, before Dietz
became so vigilant. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got something there, Biff. I&rsquo;m proud of
you,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s uncle replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be fun, too, to fool Dietz,&rdquo; Derek
chimed in excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make it even more convincing,&rdquo; Biff went on,
&ldquo;we could break camp tomorrow afternoon. Pull out
fast. Dietz wouldn&rsquo;t follow us immediately. Not until
he&rsquo;d done some diving and oyster shucking himself.
He&rsquo;d surely want to make certain we had located the
fishery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re darn right he would,&rdquo; Charles Keene said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would give us a chance to get back to
Trinit&eacute;, slip out of town, and really concentrate on
looking for your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff paused. He looked first at Derek. He felt sure
Derek would be enthusiastic about his plan. Then
he looked at his uncle. He knew his uncle was considering
the plan in every detail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Uncle Charlie finally spoke. &ldquo;Well, Biff, I like your
plan. You didn&rsquo;t know this, of course, but I was
getting more and more worried about having you and
Derek on the bottom of the ocean, with Dietz in his
high-powered boat ready to strike at any moment.
Calling off the pearl search for the time being makes
a lot of sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe we&rsquo;ll find my father,&rdquo; Derek said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s on the island, we&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; Charles Keene
said. He spoke with more conviction than he felt, to
cheer the Dutch boy up. Privately, he had many
doubts as to the possibility of finding Derek&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch go along. Help find lost white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time the giant Indian had spoken.</p>
<p>Biff shot a fast glance at his uncle. Charles Keene
shook his head. The motion was barely noticeable.
But Biff got it. He knew his uncle had some other
plan for the Carib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff said. He knew the
Indian wanted to remain in the party. &ldquo;I think maybe
my uncle has an idea where you could be a lot more
help. Right, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Keene turned to the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to be a big help to us, Crunch, it
would be better for you to go back to Dietz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No like Dietz. Bad man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that, Crunch. But, while we&rsquo;re gone&mdash;it
will only be a few days&mdash;you can keep an eye on
Dietz. You&rsquo;d still be on our side, but Dietz wouldn&rsquo;t
know that. He&rsquo;d think you were still working for him.
You&rsquo;d be our spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch a spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the tone of the Indian&rsquo;s voice, Biff could tell
that Crunch was pleased. He liked the idea of being a
spy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Crunch,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie continued.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d pretend to be still working for him, but you&rsquo;d
watch everything he did. He might even find the
pearl fishery, and we&rsquo;d surely want to know about
that. Then, when we got back, you could tell us
everything that had been going on. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch do it. He go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian rose to his feet and faded into the night
for his half-mile swim back to the island camp of the
enemy. Biff wondered what kind of a reception he
would receive from Dietz but felt sure Crunch could
take care of himself.</p>
<p>The next morning the boys and Charles Keene
were up at the first crack of dawn. Over a hasty
breakfast, they went over their plan for the last time.
As the sun boiled up out of the Atlantic, the three
headed out to sea.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before they saw Dietz&rsquo;s boat come
into sight, rocking above the horizon off their starboard
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; Charles Keene said. &ldquo;Drop anchor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek heaved the hook over. Biff was already donning
his diving apparatus. Derek was only a few moments
behind as Biff slipped into the warm waters of
the Caribbean and made his descent.</p>
<p>The boys stayed down for about half an hour.
When they surfaced and climbed aboard, Biff cracked
open an oyster. Immediately, he let out a shout and
danced up and down.</p>
<p>Derek joined in the deception. Charlie Keene put
his head together with the two boys, and for several
moments they carefully inspected an imaginary pearl
in Biff&rsquo;s empty hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>They all knew Dietz was observing their actions
through powerful binoculars.</p>
<p>With happy shouts that bounced across the waves
and reached Dietz&rsquo;s boat, Biff and Derek plunged
back into the water. They sent up several more
baskets of oysters. When they surfaced and climbed
back into the boat, they shucked a few more oysters.
Then Charles Keene shook each boy&rsquo;s hand and
clapped them on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up anchor!&rdquo; Charlie shouted. He started the motor.
The boat raced back to the camp site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look back over your shoulder, Uncle Charlie,&rdquo;
Biff said.</p>
<p>Dietz had brought his boat into the area just abandoned
by the boys and Uncle Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he dropping a marking buoy right about
where we were?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we did fool him!&rdquo; Derek sang out happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the time being, at least. But we&rsquo;ve got to
move fast. He&rsquo;ll be sampling oysters from that same
bed as fast as he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three struck camp quickly. They loaded their
gear into the cabin cruiser. With a triumphant blast
on the boat horn and a burst of shots from Charles
Keene&rsquo;s gun, they pointed the bow of the cruiser
toward La Trinit&eacute;.</p>
<p>They passed within a quarter of a mile of Dietz&rsquo;s
boat. They could see Dietz hauling in lines holding
the baskets of oysters which Specks had filled on the
bottom. They didn&rsquo;t see Crunch. He must have been
pressed into oyster diving also.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Ten minutes later, they could barely see Dietz&rsquo;s
white boat bobbing on the blue water over the imaginary
pearl bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We pulled it off, Uncle Charlie,&rdquo; Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we did, Biffo me lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we can hunt for my father,&rdquo; Derek
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll find him, too!&rdquo; Biff said confidently.</p>
<p>Charles Keene frowned. He erased the frown
quickly, but not so fast that Biff missed it.</p>
<p>Biff knew his uncle believed that Brom Zook must
have been lost at sea. The thought sent Biff&rsquo;s high
spirits plunging downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Dashed Hopes</span></h2>
<p>In La Trinit&eacute;, Biff, his uncle, and Derek moved about
with haste. Following a speedy lunch, they shopped
for enough supplies to last them for their expedition
into the interior of Martinique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step lively, boys,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie urged. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
take Dietz long to find out he&rsquo;s been fooled. And we
don&rsquo;t want him hounding us on this search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Charlie,&rdquo; Biff said, &ldquo;if Dietz comes into
Trinit&eacute; and finds our boat still moored in Treasure
Bay, won&rsquo;t he know we&rsquo;re still somewhere nearby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;ll have to take, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we took the boat up the coast&mdash;got it away
from here&mdash;that would cause him further delay,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right again, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would Dietz want to follow us when
we&rsquo;re searching for my father?&rdquo; Derek asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to know about your father as much
as we do. But for different reasons,&rdquo; Charles Keene
replied, a frown darkening his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Derek thought this over. &ldquo;If we learn some bad
news about my father&mdash;if we should learn he really
is gone&mdash;&rdquo; Derek gulped. He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself
to say out loud that they might find out that Brom
Zook was dead. &ldquo;If that is how our search should
end, then you mean there could be some doubt as to
whether the claim he originally filed is still valid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid so, Derek. I believe your claim would be
supported in time. But there would be delay after
delay as Dietz went to the courts to try to have it
invalidated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff wanted to get his friend Derek&rsquo;s mind away
from such depressing thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the boat again, Uncle Charlie. Why don&rsquo;t
we go around the point, head north along the coast,
and find a sheltered harbor where we could hide the
boat? Then we could head inland from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do, Biff. And let&rsquo;s do it right
away,&rdquo; his uncle agreed.</p>
<p>They made a run of about ten miles along the east
coast of Martinique and found a small cove between
Ste. Marie and Marigot. They beached the boat and
covered it with the lacy leaves of the giant fern
trees which grow to a height of twenty feet on
Martinique. Over the ferns they spread palm fronds.
The boat was completely hidden.</p>
<p>From the beach, they could see the peak of Mt.
Pel&eacute;e, rising nearly five thousand feet in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, what do you say we make Pel&eacute;e our first
goal?&rdquo; Charles Keene suggested. &ldquo;Your searches
haven&rsquo;t brought you that far north and east, have
they, Derek?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Let&rsquo;s move out then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the three slung a pack over his shoulders,
and they plunged into the thick tropical growth.</p>
<p>Biff was enjoying himself. If the object of their
search hadn&rsquo;t been such a serious one, if his feeling
that the search might have an unhappy ending hadn&rsquo;t
been so strong, then the exploration would have
been even more fun.</p>
<p>Martinique, Biff soon discovered, was truly a beautiful
island, one of the most beautiful places in which
he had ever been. From the top of steep ridges, the
lush, fertile valleys of the island spread out below.
Rugged peaks rose like steeples above the ridges.</p>
<p>In the rich valleys, they crossed through sugar-cane
fields.</p>
<p>Biff took his knife and slashed a stock down. Its
sweet juices oozed out of the slash. Biff pressed the
stock to his lips and sucked deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try one, Derek. Tastes good,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Banana trees grew wild almost everywhere they
went. Derek shinned up the rough, fat trunk of one
tree and yanked down a bunch. He squirreled back
down the tree and plopped on the ground to inspect
his haul. Derek&rsquo;s hands were exploring the
bunch, trying to select the ripest, fattest banana
when Charlie Keene leaped to his side and struck the
Dutch boy&rsquo;s arm a sharp blow.</p>
<p>Derek looked around in amazed alarm.</p>
<p>Charles Keene was stamping on a hairy black spider.
He had spotted the ugly insect on Derek&rsquo;s shoulder
and with one swift blow had knocked the spider to the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Mr. Keene?&rdquo; Derek looked
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close call, Derek. That spider I just knocked off
your arm is called <i>matoutou falaise</i>. That&rsquo;s the local
French name for the most poisonous spider on the
island. They make their nests in bananas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek&rsquo;s face went white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now. I got him. But after this, be
mighty careful when you pick a banana,&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie warned.</p>
<p>Now and again the party would pass a small
thatched hut. At each one, they asked questions of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tall man, very thin, with almost white hair,&rdquo;
was the description they gave of Brom Zook. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
been missing over three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The natives would only shake their heads. No,
they had seen no such man, nor had they heard of
such a stranger in these parts.</p>
<p>For three days the party trudged up and down
the ridges and peaks of the island. They questioned
a hundred or more people. They went to Deux
Choux, to Morne Vert, Le Lorrain, Grande Rivi&egrave;re,
and towns even smaller. Nowhere did they get any
leads to a missing Hollander named Brom Zook.</p>
<p>By the fourth day of the search, it was plain to
Biff and his uncle that Derek was becoming more and
more discouraged, more and more disheartened. They
tried their best to cheer up the Dutch lad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>At the end of the day, they reached the top of
Mt. Pel&eacute;e. Looking down at the sea, they could pick
out the ruins of Saint-Pierre. Once, Uncle Charlie told
the boys, Saint-Pierre had been the largest city on the
island. Then, in the early morning hours, tragedy had
struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the story about Saint-Pierre and Mt.
Pel&eacute;e, Biff?&rdquo; Uncle Charlie asked. &ldquo;You must have
heard it, Derek, when you were growing up in
Cura&ccedil;ao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek shook his head. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t remember it,
Mr. Keene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just after the turn of the century, around
1902, I believe. Saint-Pierre then had a population of
thirty thousand people. Early one morning, as the
city slept, Mt. Pel&eacute;e erupted. It shot forth a sheet of
flame and molten lava. In a matter of only a few
seconds, thirty thousand people were dead. Most of
them died in their beds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole city wiped out? In seconds?&rdquo; Biff
asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff,&rdquo; Charlie Keene said. &ldquo;There was
only one survivor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could one person survive when thirty thousand
others perished?&rdquo; Biff demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most unusual story. This person was a prisoner
in Saint-Pierre. He was in solitary confinement.
The cell he was in had stone walls several feet thick.
That&rsquo;s what saved him. The walls were so thick
they resisted the heat. The prisoner didn&rsquo;t even know
about the catastrophe until several days later when
rescue crews explored the prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff could only shake his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>That night they camped on top of the volcano and
went into Saint-Pierre the next morning. &ldquo;As you
can see,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie pointed out, &ldquo;the town has
been partly rebuilt. But today, only six thousand persons
live here where, fifty years ago, Saint-Pierre had
thirty thousand residents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inquiries were made at the police station. The
three searchers could hardly believe their ears. They
received their first lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not know the man&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; the police
officer said, &ldquo;but a man of such a description as you
give has been staying in a small pension just outside
the city for the last few months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Where is it?&rdquo; Derek cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be only too happy to take you there,&rdquo; the
courteous officer replied.</p>
<p>They rode through the volcanic ruins of Saint-Pierre
toward the gentle slope that led toward Mt.
Pel&eacute;e. Although some sections had been built up,
there were still plenty of signs of the savage destruction
caused by Mt. Pel&eacute;e&rsquo;s eruption over half a century
before.</p>
<p>Derek was in the front seat with the police officer.
Biff and Charles Keene were in the rear seat. Biff
had his fingers crossed. Both the boy and his uncle
were praying that the man the police officer referred
to might be Derek&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>The car drew up before a small vine-covered
house. Derek leaped out. The police officer led the
way. Biff and Charles Keene were right behind.</p>
<p>A broad veranda swept round three sides of the
house. The officer made an inquiry, then motioned
Derek to follow him.</p>
<p>Biff was a step behind Derek. At the far end of the
veranda, they could see a man sitting in a high-backed
wicker chair, his back to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>As they approached the chair, Biff kept his eyes on
Derek. The Dutch boy rushed forward and turned
to confront the man in the chair. Biff watched the
expression on Derek&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Biff read his answer from the disappointment which
spread over his friend&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>The man was not Brom Zook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Dietz Again</span></h2>
<p>In the morning, the three breakfasted in silence. Biff
wanted to say something to cheer up Derek. But
what was there to say? Derek&rsquo;s face was white and
drawn. It was plain to see that the Dutch boy had
had little if any sleep the night before.</p>
<p>It was Derek who broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank you both,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
feel that I can ask you to continue this search any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go along with you just as long as you want
us to,&rdquo; Biff spoke up loyally. &ldquo;Right, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Derek continued. &ldquo;Not in this
section of Martinique. I&rsquo;m sure that if my father were
anywhere around here, we&rsquo;d have heard something
about it&mdash;some rumor, some tale of a tall white man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you there, Derek,&rdquo; Charles Keene
said. &ldquo;But there is much of Martinique still to be
searched. The southern part, down around English
Bay. That&rsquo;s south of the spot where we believe your
father located the pearl fishery. He might have gone
into hiding down that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Keene,&rdquo; Derek said
bravely, &ldquo;that if he was lost at sea, and washed
ashore, then it would be in that section of
Martinique?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Keene didn&rsquo;t reply. Derek had read his
thoughts.</p>
<p>Right after breakfast, the three headed back across
Martinique toward the cove where they had hidden
their boat. It was about a twenty-mile trip, and they
reached the spot just at dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better spend the night here,&rdquo; Uncle
Charlie said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know this coast too well. Might
run into a reef if we try to make it to Trinit&eacute; tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exhausted from their long and fruitless search, the
three slept that night under a clear sky, the sleep of
the overtired. The sun was already up and blazing
when they woke. A quick swim refreshed them after
their hard sleep, and half an hour later they were
on their way back down the coast.</p>
<p>They reached Trinit&eacute; by midmorning.</p>
<p>After mooring the boat, they held a conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your plans now, Derek?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we could continue searching for the pearl
fishery. Or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we could go south and look for your father,&rdquo;
Biff completed Derek&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about this?&rdquo; Uncle Charlie cut in. &ldquo;Suppose
Biff and I keep on looking for the pearls and you go
off for a few days on your own?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Biff frowned at these words. He knew his uncle&rsquo;s
intentions were good, but he also felt that if Derek
left them, he&rsquo;d be cut off from the only friends he
had on Martinique. He&rsquo;d be lonely and engaged in a
search with his heart heavy at the prospect of what
he might discover.</p>
<p>Biff didn&rsquo;t quite know how to tell his uncle this.
He didn&rsquo;t want to contradict him. He didn&rsquo;t have
to. As he was puzzling a way out of the suggestion
made by his uncle, he heard a shout. He looked in
the direction the hail had come from. Lumbering down
the dock, a broad grin on his strong face, came
Crunch.</p>
<p>The giant Indian was delighted to rejoin Biff, his
uncle, and Derek. Brilliant white teeth glinted in the
sunlight as Crunch wore a perpetual grin on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Dietz?&rdquo; Uncle Charlie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he locate the pearl fishery while we were
gone?&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s question tumbled out after his uncle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No find fishery,&rdquo; Crunch said, still grinning.
&ldquo;Dietz look hard, though. Very mad when he find
how you fool him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Biff said. All of them smiled at his news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dietz do something else,&rdquo; Crunch went on.
&ldquo;Him get some kind of paper from government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Crunch? What sort of paper?&rdquo;
Charles Keene asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch not understand. Ask questions though.
Paper say maybe you don&rsquo;t find fishery very sudden,
then claim no good any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can that be, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Biff. I&rsquo;d have to see a copy of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copy of paper nailed up in post office,&rdquo; Crunch
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for, then? Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They leaped into a native taxi, urging the driver
to speed and more speed. The taxi creaked and
groaned, but it got them there.</p>
<p>In the post office the three read the copy of the
document carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so good, is it, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand it, Mr. Keene,&rdquo; Derek
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Derek, cutting through the legal phraseology,
it comes down to this: Dietz went to Fort-de-France
while we were searching for your father.
He has challenged your right to the claim, on the
grounds that you&rsquo;re a minor. How old are you,
Derek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be eighteen my next birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what Dietz has obtained&mdash;in legal terms&mdash;is
a temporary injunction. It goes into effect five days
from now. At that time, the claim and the working
permit will be suspended until the courts decide
whether Derek is the rightful heir to the claim. I&rsquo;m
sorry, Derek,&rdquo; Charlie Keene said soberly, &ldquo;but Dietz
has obtained this injunction on the grounds that your
father is deceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments silence, Biff spoke up. &ldquo;We
still have five days, then, to find the fishery. If we
did, how would that affect the injunction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, going back to the unwritten law of &lsquo;finders
keepers,&rsquo; Derek would have an excellent chance of
retaining the rights, despite any court battle Dietz
might put up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Derek?&rdquo; Biff asked. &ldquo;Shall we
go pearl diving again? I know you want to continue
the search for your father, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, Biff. It&rsquo;s only five days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, whether we find the fishery or not,
we&rsquo;ll all continue looking for your father until the
case comes up in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment there, young fellow,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie
cut in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll continue with Derek. <i>You</i> won&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be here!&rdquo; Biff was amazed. &ldquo;Where am I
going to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your way back to Indianapolis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. School. I forgot.&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got five days still. Let&rsquo;s make the most
of them,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>It took them two hours to restock their supplies,
get air for the diving tanks, and return to the dock.
At the end of the dock, lounging against a mooring
post, was Dietz. He had an evil expression of triumph
on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever give up?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Specks hovered behind him.</p>
<p>None of the three answered their enemy. They got
into the boat and prepared to cast off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey? Come back here! Where do you think
you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dietz&rsquo;s startled question was directed at Crunch.
Crunch had jumped into the boat with the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch go with friends. No work for bad man
any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll still be working for me!&rdquo; Dietz shouted
back in anger. &ldquo;If you find the fishery, you&rsquo;ll be
finding it for me, because I&rsquo;ll win it in court!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Attack from the Deep</span></h2>
<p>For the next three days, activity went on at a
feverish pace. Camp was hastily set up again on the
same island, and even when it was late in the day,
Biff, Derek, and Uncle Charlie would try another spot
hoping to locate the fishery.</p>
<p>They dived from sunup to sundown. The only rest
period for Biff and Derek came when Uncle Charlie
dashed into Trinit&eacute; to replenish the air tanks.</p>
<p>The piles of shucked oyster shells grew higher and
higher. No pearls were found. The boys worked
desperately against time, but as the first day passed,
then the second, then the third, they worked with
heavy hearts. The time limit was drawing near.</p>
<p>Dietz made no further attacks. He was content
now to fight his battle in the courts. But the pearl
fishers knew he was still in the area. They saw his
boat from time to time. He was keeping his distance,
but he was still watching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>However, even by using binoculars, Dietz would
be unable to determine whether the boys located
the pearl fishery. He could only learn this by finding
out the results of the daily diving. He would have to
know what the opened oysters yielded. For this reason,
a nightly guard was kept. Although Dietz was going
to use the courts, the search party didn&rsquo;t want him to
know if and when they did locate the fishery. Crunch
insisted on taking the night guard duty. He also
worked during the day. Biff often wondered when
the big Indian slept.</p>
<p>Although the danger from Dietz had lessened,
Charlie Keene kept reminding the boys of the danger
that always awaited them when they were diving.</p>
<p>It struck suddenly and viciously on the fourth morning
of their diving.</p>
<p>Biff and Derek were down in forty-eight feet
of water. They had been digging out oysters for half
an hour. Basket after basket had been hauled up.</p>
<p>Waiting for his basket to be lowered to him, Biff
was suddenly spun around by a swirl of water. It
felt as if he had been caught in a whirlpool. Biff
cleared his mask. He looked around. Coming at him
out of the murky dark waters was a giant shark. The
killer swept by within a foot, then turned and slashed
back.</p>
<p>Biff looked frantically for Derek. He saw his glimmering
white shape ten feet away. Approaching
Derek was a second shark.</p>
<p>The sharks hadn&rsquo;t struck yet. It seemed they were
inspecting their prey, waiting before their razor-sharp
teeth tore at the boys&rsquo; bodies. Biff swam quickly
over to Derek. He grabbed his arm and pointed. The
two huge sharks were motionless, their wicked eyes
on the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1116" />
<p class="caption"><i>Coming at him out of the murky dark waters was a giant shark</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Biff took a deep breath, raised his mask just enough
to clear his mouth, and shouted as loud as he could.
His shout, of course, made no sound. But Biff knew
that the force of the breath expelled by his shout
would send a shock wave in the direction of the
sharks. He had read that this was one of the best ways
of delaying an attack by an undersea monster.</p>
<p>The shout worked. The sharks swam around the
boys in circles. But Biff knew that any second they
would strike.</p>
<p>There was no time now to go by the book in getting
to the surface. Biff jammed his face mask on, quickly
cleared it of water, grabbed Derek by the arm, and
shoved him upward. He himself followed, propelling
himself as fast as he could. Both boys had jettisoned
their belts instantly.</p>
<p>Breaking the surface, Biff gasped to his uncle,
&ldquo;Sharks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Keene lost no time. He grabbed Derek,
who was closer, and hauled him into the boat. Crunch
lifted Biff in.</p>
<p>They were no sooner in the boat than two shark
fins cut the water, circling nearer and nearer to the
craft.</p>
<p>Biff and Derek lay gasping on the bottom of the
boat. Their rapid ascent had drained their bodies of
oxygen and strength.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s uncle quickly started the motor and got away
from the spot at full speed. He had seen the size of
the sharks. They were big enough to overturn the
dory if they struck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>By the time they reached the island camp, the boys
had somewhat recovered. But Biff was still shaking
as if he had a chill, and Derek&rsquo;s face was drawn and
white.</p>
<p>The narrow escape the boys had undergone was
not without its reward, however.</p>
<p>All four of the pearl fishers&mdash;Crunch was now one
of them&mdash;were shucking oysters after a rest and the
noonday meal.</p>
<p>Biff, growing more and more bored with the tough
job of opening and examining oysters, was about to
discard a shell when he noticed a raised protuberance
in the exact center on the shell. He took off his
glove and dug at the raised part with a fingernail. His
excitement grew. Seconds later he dug out an almost
perfectly shaped white pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one! I&rsquo;ve got one!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>The others crowded around him. Biff handed the
pearl to his uncle.</p>
<p>Charlie Keene inspected it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no expert, Biff. But the color, and particularly
the shape, of this pearl&mdash;I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;ve found
a really valuable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much? How much is it worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell. Only an expert could. But it&rsquo;s a
white pearl&mdash;they&rsquo;re the most valuable. And it&rsquo;s almost
perfectly round. It could be worth several thousands
of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoopee!&rdquo; Biff shouted. &ldquo;Let me at more of those
oysters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interest quickened. The four worked in silence, but
they worked fast. Oyster after oyster was opened,
carefully inspected, then tossed aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Derek found the next one. It, too, was perfectly
shaped, but slightly smaller than the one Biff had
found.</p>
<p>It was Crunch who came through with the topper.
A big grin on his face, Crunch came over to Biff and
held our his huge hand. In the center of his palm
was a pearl twice the size of those already found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it! This is it! Look at Crunch&rsquo;s pearl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they all crowded around. This was a real
beauty. It didn&rsquo;t take an expert to know that Crunch
had found a pearl of great value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;ve found it, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo; Biff asked.
&ldquo;I mean the fishery Derek&rsquo;s father discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be, Biff. It darn well could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked at Derek. There was a smile on the
Dutch boy&rsquo;s face. Then the smile disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Derek?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father found black pearls,&rdquo; Derek replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all colors, Derek,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie told
him. &ldquo;Actually, the black ones aren&rsquo;t as valuable as
the white. They&rsquo;re valuable, all right, especially if
they&rsquo;re perfectly matched, as those two your father
sent us were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel a lot more certain that we&rsquo;d found the
right place if we found some black ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back down when we finish these oysters,&rdquo;
Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all those sharks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny thing about sharks,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie said.
&ldquo;Although they are the pearl diver&rsquo;s greatest enemy,
they can also help produce the pearl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Biff wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;The best pearl is the perfectly round pearl. The
foreign body which gets into the oyster must be perfectly
round to produce the perfect pearl. These
round objects are the eggs of parasitic worms. The
adult worms are the parasites of sharks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So where you find sharks, you can find pearls?&rdquo;
Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, Biff. What I mean is this: where
there are pearl fisheries, the perfect pearls come from
the eggs the shark&rsquo;s parasites lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more pearls were found in the batch dug that
morning. It was growing late in the afternoon. They
decided to go back to the morning&rsquo;s site, and if no
sharks were in evidence, they&rsquo;d try half an hour&rsquo;s
diving.</p>
<p>They returned to the same site. Biff and Derek
went overside. Before they started scooping up oysters,
they made sure no sharks were around. Biff
loaded one basket and sent it up. He saw Derek send
one up. Biff filled another. He looked at his watch.
They&rsquo;d been down twenty minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more basket,&rdquo; Biff said to himself, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ll call it a day.&rdquo; He turned in Derek&rsquo;s direction
to signal to him that this was the last basket. Roiling
water ahead pushed an alarm button in Biff&rsquo;s mind. He
increased his speed.</p>
<p>Derek was being attacked savagely by giant band
shells. They swarmed around him, slashing at him
with their claw-shaped, horny shells.</p>
<p>Biff whipped out his knife and shot into action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>The giant band shells, many times the size of the ordinary
conch shell, are the only known shell fish to attack
human beings. They have a tough, scimitar-shaped
muscle which they use as a door to close the opening
at the large end of the shell. While other conches use
this muscle only as a door, the giant band shell uses it
as a weapon. The end of the muscle is hooked and razor
sharp. The giant band shell springs at a man, using
a second muscle to propel itself, then slashes and cuts
with its &ldquo;door.&rdquo; In moments, it can cut a man&rsquo;s body
to shreds.</p>
<p>These giants were surrounding Derek. Up close,
Biff could see Derek had already received several cuts.
Biff knew what this meant. Sharks would come racing
through the water, crazed with hunger by the smell of
blood.</p>
<p>Biff slashed away at the band shells with his knife.
It did no good. The giant shells continued their attack,
some of them turning on Biff. There was only
one thing to do. Derek was nearly helpless. Biff
grabbed him. He shoved him upward with all his
strength. Derek disappeared above him. Now the
band shells turned their full attack on Biff. He fought
them off, trying at the same time to rise. Several of
them tried to fasten onto Biff&rsquo;s legs. He kicked out
desperately. He thrust down with his open hands and
shot upward. The slower moving band shells were
left behind. Biff reached the surface. He lost no time
in scrambling into the boat. Uncle Charlie already had
pulled Derek, bleeding, into the boat.</p>
<p>Biff just made it. No sooner was he in the boat
than the waters around it boiled with maddened sharks,
searching for the source of the blood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Double Find</span></h2>
<p>Derek&rsquo;s cuts from the giant band shells were many
but not deep ones. Biff and his uncle cleaned the
cuts, treated them with a disinfectant, and put Derek
to bed.</p>
<p>The Dutch boy was not seriously wounded, but
he was suffering from shock. The thing to do, Biff
knew, was to keep him warm and quiet. Charlie
Keene gave Derek half a sleeping tablet, and the
boy finally dozed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a day! Two narrow escapes. We should
never have gone back,&rdquo; Charles Keene said. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t tell me there were clam and conch shells in
that bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know they were dangerous,&rdquo; Biff replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just to see if we could find some black pearls,&rdquo;
his uncle commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s open the oysters we dug,&rdquo; Biff suggested.
&ldquo;Derek seems to be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, Biff came back to the tent. Derek
stirred restlessly in his sleep. Biff lighted a lamp
Derek suddenly sat upright. Biff went to his side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;You all right, Derek?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so. I was dreaming. But&mdash;&rdquo; Derek
touched a bandaged cut gingerly. &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may make you feel even better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff held out his hand. He thrust it under Derek&rsquo;s
eyes. The hand held a black pearl.</p>
<p>The next morning, convinced they had located
Brom Zook&rsquo;s fabulous pearl fishery, camp was broken.
Gear was stored in the cabin cruiser. The tent was
struck. By noon the four pearl searchers were back
in La Trinit&eacute;.</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s happiness was mingled with sadness.
One adventure was over. Derek&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s claim was
safe. The quest had been successful. But Brom Zook,
Derek&rsquo;s father, was still missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask you to stay with me any longer,&rdquo; Derek
said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done more than enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick with you as long as you want me to,
Derek,&rdquo; Charlie Keene said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes for me, too, Derek,&rdquo; Biff added, hoping
his uncle would not mention school. &ldquo;What are you
going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay on in Martinique for a while.
I&rsquo;m going to every town and village on the island
until I make as certain as possible my father isn&rsquo;t
here. Then&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo; Derek stopped.</p>
<p>Biff knew what his friend was thinking. He knew
that Derek would then have to come to the conclusion
that his father had been lost at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Crunch? Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch go back up mountains. Stay with little
brother for while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;You found him? You didn&rsquo;t tell us that!&rdquo; Biff exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too busy finding pearls. Crunch no want to
bother you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we said we&rsquo;d try to clear your brother. We
still mean to do so, don&rsquo;t we, Uncle Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly do, Crunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come with Crunch to talk to little brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet, Crunch,&rdquo; Biff replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Crunch can help Derek too,&rdquo; the Indian
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? What do you mean?&rdquo; Biff demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch maybe help Derek find father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek touched the Indian on the arm. &ldquo;Anything
you do will help, Crunch. But have you any clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch not sure. Hear about white man up in
mountain called Carbet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek grabbed the Indian by both shoulders and
shook him. &ldquo;Tell me! Tell me about the white man,&rdquo;
he urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little brother tell story. Little brother live in
mountains, in small shack. Tell about sick white man.
White man come to mountains two months, maybe
three months, maybe more. Long time ago. Get very
sick. Priests take white man in. Maybe your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we go there right now?&rdquo; Derek asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take long time. Hard trip up mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started out late that afternoon. Night overtook
the party before their journey was half completed.
Exhausted by the hard day and the excitement
of Crunch&rsquo;s clue, the first real one Derek had, all
four slept in the open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>By midmorning the next day, they reached the
shack where Crunch&rsquo;s brother Moti lived. Moti told
the same story Crunch had told the day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this place far from here?&rdquo; Derek asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hour away,&rdquo; Moti replied.</p>
<p>From Moti&rsquo;s description of the place, Uncle Charlie
came to the conclusion it was a small monastery.</p>
<p>Moti led them to it. A bearded monk took them
inside. Derek babbled out the story of his search. The
monk bowed his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please wait,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The monk went down a long, narrow passage. He
turned a corner and was out of sight.</p>
<p>Derek&rsquo;s heart was throbbing. Biff and his uncle
were tense with hope.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. The shuffling of feet was heard.
The monk was halfway back to the waiting group
when another figure came into the passage. He was
tall, gaunt, wasted by illness.</p>
<p>But there was a smile of happiness on his face.</p>
<p>Derek Zook raced down the passageway to meet
his father.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Biff, his uncle, Derek, and his father were sitting
in the patio of the Sans Souci. Hummingbirds darted
in and out of the bougainvillea which poured over
the terrace. It was the afternoon of the day after Brom
Zook had been found.</p>
<p>Brom Zook&rsquo;s story was short. On the day he had
mailed the letters and pearls to his son and to Charles
Keene, he discovered he was being followed. He had
thought it best to disappear into the hills until his
claim could be filed and acted upon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>In the hills, he had become ill of a tropical fever.
He had been found by a monk and carried to the
monastery. There he had lain close to death for
weeks, not knowing what was going on about him.</p>
<p>Only in the last two weeks had he come back to
his senses. The monks had insisted that he stay with
them until he was strong enough to travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess that about winds up my stay here
in the Caribbean,&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get back to
good old Indianapolis and school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hate to see you go, Biff,&rdquo; Derek said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you come back and visit us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or maybe you could come to Indianapolis,&rdquo; Biff
invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; Derek said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more piece of business,&rdquo; Uncle Charlie cut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Keene?&rdquo; Brom Zook asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make sure that we found the same pearl
fishery you discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo; Brom Zook glanced at his watch.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to get back to Cura&ccedil;ao. Why don&rsquo;t you
get everything ready, and the boys and I will take a
run down the coast in the boat? They can show me
their spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. You ought to be back in a couple of hours.
I&rsquo;ll find Crunch, and he can help me,&rdquo; Charlie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Crunch, Uncle Charlie? Is he going
back with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Biff. He&rsquo;s going to stay here until I send back
word about his brother. I talked to Moti. I feel sure
we can straighten things out in Cura&ccedil;ao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Crunch and Moti they can count on that,&rdquo;
Brom Zook said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>The run down the coast was a pleasant one. Biff
steered the cruiser over the spot where they had
located the pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this look like the place, sir?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>Brom Zook took a sight on an island to the cruiser&rsquo;s
portside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it, all right. And there should be thousands
of dollars&rsquo; worth of pearls beneath us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Biff, Derek, and his father were approaching
the harbor in Baie du Tr&eacute;sor, they saw Dietz and
Specks in their boat, heading in the direction of the
pearl fishery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do them any good now,&rdquo; Brom Zook said.
&ldquo;The injunction he obtained has been cancelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched the boat until it was nearly out of
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Derek shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>Brom Zook and Biff looked in the direction Derek
was pointing. They saw the ugly, menacing clouds,
forerunners of a <i>chabasco</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll strike in a few moments,&rdquo; Brom Zook said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And right at the spot we last saw Dietz,&rdquo; Biff
shouted. The winds were already getting heavier
in the harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do nothing to help them. We&rsquo;re too far
away.&rdquo; Derek&rsquo;s father said soberly.</p>
<p>The <i>chabasco</i> struck. Dietz&rsquo;s boat was right in the
center of its fury. There was little chance that he
and Specks would escape the storm&rsquo;s vengeance.</p>

<br />MYSTERY OF
<br />THE CARIBBEAN PEARLS</span></h3>
<p class="center">By ANDY ADAMS</p>
<p>A mirror-image &ldquo;twin&rdquo; with a Continental
accent, a pair of matched <i>black</i> pearls
coveted by a sinister would-be claim-jumper,
and a mammoth Carib Indian who
refrains from crushing a man at the command
of &ldquo;voodoo&rdquo; spirits confront Biff
Brewster when he leaves his Indianapolis
home to answer an urgent SOS from his
uncle, Charles Keene.</p>
<p>Keene, on a trouble-shooting assignment
in the Netherlands, Antilles, sends the SOS
in a desperate, last-ditch attempt to save
a valuable pearl fishery, belonging to his
friend, Brom Zook, from being &ldquo;staked&rdquo; by
thieves. Zook, who must prove his right to
the pearl fishery claim within the set time
limit, has mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p>Biff and Derek, Brom Zook&rsquo;s seventeen-year-old
son, accidentally board the same
plane in Miami and innocently exchange
&ldquo;identities&rdquo; to play a joke. However, the
joke backfires when Biff is kidnapped at
the Willemstad Airport by the unscrupulous
adventurers who want the pearl fishery.</p>
<p>But Biff, no stranger to mystery or challenging
situations, uses his head and his
courage at the crucial moments. His adventures
in captivity, his use of &ldquo;voodoo&rdquo; to
engineer escapes, his repeated changes of
identity with his &ldquo;twin,&rdquo; Derek, their search
for the lost pearl fishery and its rightful
owner, and their final triumph over their
adversaries are component parts of the tale
told in <i>Mystery of the Caribbean Pearls</i>.</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
